## Can Machines Think?

[**Alan Turing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) asked, "**I propose the question, can machines think?**". Can a computer achieve a state of consciousness? Distinguishing a bot from a human has lately become so overwhelming. Suddenly humans sound like bots.

We have always had a way to distinguish bots from real humans but everything has since become so unreal. Recent advancements in technology are outpacing [Moore's Law](https://blog.bunnieabc.com/posts/new-macbook-pro-14-16-overview-specs-96-gb-ram/). We are now living in an age with a technology that maybe did not exist in the realms of magic 50 years ago. **The Age of AI.**

### The Turing Test.

Alan Turing would later come up with a thesis, can a computer be able to mimic human intelligence in certain conditions? Years later this was used to distinguish humans from computers.

Here is how it worked:

If a computer and a person were to be questioned about a specific topic and their answers evaluated by a human without them knowing which answers came from either, would they be able to distinguish between the human and the computer?

When the evaluator was unable to distinguish between the two then the computer was considered to have Artificial Intelligence.

This worked until it was superseded by the powerful tech we now have,  other tests were made to give distinction. These include: The [Marcus Test, Lovelace test 2.0,](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Turing-test) and the Reverse Turing test which involves a human proving to a computer that they are not a computer - examples of these are CAPTCHA (**Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart**)
