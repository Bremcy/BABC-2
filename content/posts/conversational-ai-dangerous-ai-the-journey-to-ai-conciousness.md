## Can Machines Think?

[**Alan Turing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) asked, "**I propose the question, can machines think?**". Can a computer achieve a state of consciousness? Distinguishing a bot from a human has lately become so overwhelming. Suddenly humans sound like bots.

We have always had a way to distinguish bots from real humans but everything has since become so unreal. Recent advancements in technology are outpacing [Moore's Law](https://blog.bunnieabc.com/posts/new-macbook-pro-14-16-overview-specs-96-gb-ram/). We are now living in an age with a technology that maybe did not exist in the realms of magic 50 years ago. **The Age of AI.**

### The Turing Test.

Alan Turing would later come up with a thesis, can a computer mimic human intelligence in certain conditions? Years later this was used to distinguish humans from computers.

Here is how it worked:

Suppose a computer and a person were to be questioned about a specific topic and their answers evaluated by a human without them knowing which answers came from either. Would they be able to distinguish between the human and the computer?

When the evaluator could not distinguish between the two, the computer was considered to have Artificial Intelligence.

This worked until it was superseded by the powerful tech we now have,  other tests were made to give distinction. These include: The [Marcus Test, Lovelace test 2.0,](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/Turing-test) and the Reverse Turing test which involves a human proving to a computer that they are not a computer - examples of these are CAPTCHA (**Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart**)

### The Rise of Conversational AI

### Conv AI, what is it?

Behind conversational AI lies a lot of machine learning, Large volumes of data, and a lot of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to try and mimic humans' way of communicating. It involves four steps:

* Allowing user input (Either speech or text)
* Analyzing input.
* Dialog management - used to formulate a response in a way that mimics humans.
* Reinforcement learning to improve the responses.

  But just because something is readable doesn't mean it makes sense. The best application of this technology is to automate repetitive tasks which could include
* Customer care bot
* Improving & debugging code
* Summarizing text.

  **This powerful application of AI comes with a set of disruptions:**
* Piracy - since these models are trained on massive data collected on the web.
* Low-quality content
* Content lacks a human touch like blog posts from 2000 that made you feel a human experience - Something AI will probably never achieve.
* Many times it's too perfect, easy to understand, etc.
