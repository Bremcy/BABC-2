Video editing has never been easy.it takes a lot of time and energy to make something small. With different video editors in the market, it can be confusing and hard to choose the one that suits your needs but what if I told you there is one tool that meets all your needs in one place. It's browser-based and also comes with an app for Android and iOS users. Am I talking to no other but Clipchamp want to know how it works? make sure you read till the end.

# What is ClimpChamp?

It's a video editor as you would expect more like Canva but now great with a ton of features and a nice UI.climpchamp is good for creating social media assets or maybe if you are a newbie and want to set your foot into video editing. Or even if you are a content creator.

The nice Ui as I mentioned is easy to use with satisfying animations. The tools preset is very simple to use. The naming of menus is straight forward if for example, you are in the video menu all the tools are in one place and the same goes for images and audio.

## pricing

The best part about Clipchamp is that it's free to use. You also get free templates with no watermarks of the sort, like you would find in most free video editors. You can also download high-quality 1080p video exports still with this free plan.

but also if you want to take your editing to the next level there is a premium subscription which goes for about $7.99. I know you are probably asking why you need to upgrade your plan whereas the free one comes with a ton full of features and even exceeds expectations but ill tell you why you need the premium plan just stick to the end.

## UI and UX (interface and user experience)

The first thing to catch your eye when you enter the website is the nice interface, well-arranged menus, and cool animations all over the place.

For newbies, you don't have to struggle to get around some things. Everything is in one place. All the magic happens when you enter the templates' menu where you can build your template or even start by using the prebuilt template just as you would do with Canva. For YouTubers and all content creators, the major challenge is actually finding the right aspect ratios for your videos thumbnails, or even images on social media, but worry no more since Climpchamp takes care of everything for you and with one click of a button you are good to go.

## screen recording

When you enter the screen recording menu you will be required to choose one out of the four options i.e. camera, screen, camera & screen, and text to speech. Each does as the name states very easy and straight forward.

All you are required to do is to grant the webcam and mic permissions then start recording your video easy pizzy right? mostly applicable in webinars

The built-in text-to-speech is like a robot narrator where you put your text in the required field and choose a language pitch and speed to your liking. _A small tip:_ make sure it sounds like a human. Because as I said before text-to-speech is like a robot you must control it to give you a human realistic voice. When you are done, save the clip and drag it to the timeline of your video ready to use. Cool right!
