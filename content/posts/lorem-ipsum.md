## This is a random A/B test

[**Renaming Files**](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/config-files/#renaming-files)

Changing the name of a Front Matter Template in Forestry will rename the config file in the repository.

Changing the file name of a config file in your repository will not rename the Front Matter Template in Forestry. Instead, a new Front Matter Template will be created with the new name, and the original template will remain in Forestry.

### [**Adding New Files**](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/config-files/#adding-new-files)

New Front Matter Templates can be added to your repository, and will be added to the CMS upon import.

Front Matter Template config files have a strict naming convention:

* File names must be all lowercase
* File names must use dashes in place of spaces
* File names can not contain underscores or other special characters

E.g, **`Example Template`** becomes **`example-template.yml`**
