According to Google's Webmaster guidelines, content generated by AI models is not accurate, lacks human touch hence will be degraded and marked as spam. Google is the world's first stop site for people searching for answers.

In the world of content generation, AI generated content has now become a threat since it's hard to notice with naked eyes but there is how "AI talks" and this tools, both paid and free are going to help you detect AI behind the scenes.

## 1. [Writer](https://writer.com/ai-content-detector/)

I stambled onto King Solomon's mines and met this tool, not even Open AI has such a sleek interface leave alone a GPT3 detector. It is powered up by a thirdparty API thus has limits on the number of characters that can be evaluated (currently at 1500 characters) this being their only bottleneck.

Writer allows has two ways to evaluate your text, by inserting the final URl or by simply pasting your text. After passing or failing the litmus test results  are displayed on the RHS in percentage form and a suggestion on how to improve the text by rephrasing. You literally dont have to signup for an account to use the free version. To analyse content at largescale, use the paid version which has no limits.

## 2. [Content at Scale](https://contentatscale.ai/ai-content-detector/)

This is what Content at Scale say about themselves, 

> This isnâ€™t an AI writing assistant, this is a human level, long-form, blog post producing machine!

They use a mix of three AI engines to rephrase your content incase it fails and you need to clear the small errors, sometimes you write content and AI insists "That's AI generated" so you have to rephrase afew words. I never analyse articles that I have written myself but I once in a while check submissions done by other authors. I put this post into the test:  [You all will very soon forget ChatGPT3](https://www.bunnieabc.com/posts/you-all-will-very-soon-forget-chatgpt3/) to see how this tool thinks of it and also illustrate the capabilities. Below are the results.

For my esteemed mobile device users:

I think they still need to work on their UI especially the Tablet mode.

## [Originality.AI](https://originality.ai/)

Originality was built with publishers in mind and there fore since good things come in pairs, it comes with a plagirism detector tool too which they think "could be better than your current dusty tool".

I put this article into test [Step-by-Step Guide to Setting up Microsoft Purview with Watermarks](https://www.bunnieabc.com/posts/step-by-step-guide-to-setting-up-microsoft-purview-with-watermarks/) and this were the results.
