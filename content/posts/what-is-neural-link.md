Our brains are the most complex and fascinating organs in our body. Because come to think of it, inside our brains, billions of neurons communicate with each other, making trillions of connections that are referred to as synapses, therefore our brains are just like electronic devices that send signals to all the body parts through the nervous system.

Hence, we can move a hand or any other body part through these signals. What Scientists did is they took this basic idea and made chips (neural links) that could put electrodes in our brain and this enabled them to record our brain signals and send and receive information to the brain basically that's what neural link is all about.

# Is the neural link safe?

The neural link is not put directly in the brain but in a small hole about 25Â mm in diameter on the skull. Neurosurgeons that perform these surgeries have to be extremely careful with the brain, which is why there is a whole dedicated **Neurosurgical Robot** that is capable of inserting the (link) or the electrodes within the shortest time possible.

There have been successful attempts already where they put neural link microchips into (Paige) a 9-year-old monkey, and he was able to play pong with his mind.

Another attempt was with a pig where they were able to read signals. from its limbs and simulate it in real time,yet no humans have already been tested with this technology ,but the future for the neural link is quite promising.

## What will the neural link do?

Because we are now living in the AI world, so if let's say this technology becomes a thing then we will be able to keep pace with the fast rise in technology of AI where you can even be able to control electronic devices using your mind only.

People with brain-related conditions e.g. blindness will now be able to restore sight. how? So the neural link will be connected to your phone which will also be connected to a camera that will record real-time scenes and the feed will be sent to the phone which will also convert the information to machine-readable from

Information sent to the neural chip will now be interpreted by the electrodes implanted directly in the visual cortex of our brain. This will allow people with blindness. from birth to see and perceive the world as we do.

Also, if the neural link can restore sight, it can potentially restore body paralysis. Still wondering how? So basically the neural link can read the brain motor signals through the electrodes in the motor cortex of our brain and the information is then decoded in real-time, so the idea here is that people with full body paralysis condition can be able to control prosthetic limbs or other devices simply by thinking about it.
