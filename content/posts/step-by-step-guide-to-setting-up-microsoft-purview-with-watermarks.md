According to research done by sharfshark and comparitech the study showed that every year there are millions of data leaked every year, eg California has suffered the most data breaches than other states in a 15-year period the results also showed that in these breaches more than 5.6 sensitive billion records were exposed between 2005 and 2020. But 2021 was so far the worst year for big companies like Microsoft where 10.8 billion top secret records were leaked.

Other notable breaches in 2021. were 

> * Facebook (533 million) records
> * Comcast (1.5 billion) records
> * Byeka (400 million) records
> * Brazilian resident data leak (660 million) records
> * LinkedIn (500 million) records

But since all this is happening we have to ask ourselves who leaks this data, how can we protect our company data from being such victims, and let's say our data is leaked can we trace it back to whoever leaked it. so join me in this journey as we talk a look at some of the new protection features Microsoft has put into place to keep companies' information safe.

# What is Microsoft Purview?

It's an intelligent solution that helps protect your data from loss and govern your data whenever you share it. Remember you need to have Microsoft E5 llicense to enjoy full capabilities and protections.

Data is the most valuable asset in every organization and when data is not safe or falls in the wrong hands it can be very dangerous, Microsoft knows this that's why they have several measures that you can take. to make sure your organization's data is safe. one method is setting up **Microsoft Teams meeting protection with watermarks.** This makes sure that all the sensitive information cannot be leaked since the screen is filled with watermarks that show your email address on the presentation feed. This simple but helpful feature helps organizations keep their conversation safe and private. But also in case of data leakages, it can be used to trace back the leak because of the email watermarks all over the screen.
