am sure you have once or twice heard the word trade was invented long ago by our ancestors..like everything we do nowadays involves trade. there are many types of 

trade but today let's focus on one trade here blockchain, in simple terms ill give you an example if I was to sell my laptop I would look at a store I trust eBay being one of them 

jiji Kenya etc. but most of the time your first option is not eBay or jumia its that one friend who told you that he had a friend 

 who also wanted a laptop or would give you a great dealeven iffit'ss something in return.but whenever a deal exceedss more thanone personniss completely difficult to trust each other. 

after having the same problem for a while, another friend introduced me to the blockchain. and that's why I want you my friend to know it, and have a better understanding of it.

## what is blockchain?

blockchain technology is just the same as the one I mentioned before but instead of having that middle friend to connect you will the buyer,, you are granted the power to connect directly 

without having any middlemen. and when I talk about middlemen I mean banks, brands, and companies that connect you and get something in return actually in the world we live it's hard to trust any

of these companies especially if you are trading or exchanging something sensitive.

## so how does blockchain work?

it's basically a network of computers that all have the same history of transactions. so instead of one bank company having all your transaction data. now with blockchain, you can have that information

in your computer, I can also have it on mine and with this technology, the transactions are validated by everyone to make sure the transaction is legit

## if everyone validates how do I believe blockchain is secure?

Don't worry if you are asking yourself the same thing we have all been there? blockchain uses cryptography to basically encode all the transactions. so everyone can actually see all the validated transactions

but you can not read what exactly was sold or bought. and remember even if anyone can see the transactions it's not actually trackable of who actually did the transaction in conclusion blockchain is like a ledger

 ortransactionn system where all things that are being traded are not owned by a companybut byy  everyone in theworld that'ss why in other words blockchainis referredd to us peer to peer network 

## is blockchain the same as bitcoin?

as much as you would love to hear me say yes blockchain is bitcoin but the answer is no, why ill tell you may be the first time to hear bitcoin was in a movie where the bad guys maybe kidnapped someone

and asked to be paid maybe in bitcoin or even after a hacker hacking maybe your laptop asks for money in terms of bitcoin did you ever ask yourself why...

many say that bitcoin is used to do illegal businesses but that is a big misconception. bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency at the time of writing this blog it is mostly used to trade 

across the internet and even in other areas even banks this is because it's simple and ideal and the best part is that its value keeps rising up and if you are an investor bitcoin is something you should look at

## is bitcoin the future?

As of now blockchain is still in the research state and researchers are still finding some of the use cases to use blockchain. but as of no,w there is actually a lot of public blockchains like bitcoin and Ethereum and even types of private

bitcoins which are not yet released but eventually will what we are sure of is that blockchain is surely going to be the future of trade and this means dying of

companies like banks or even business middlemen another use case is cryptography actually a good example is the WhatsApp app which uses cryptography to encrypt messages from the sender and receiver making sure all the conversation is kept between the two of you safe and secret
