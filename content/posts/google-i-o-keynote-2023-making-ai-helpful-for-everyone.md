on May 10 2023 google graced the california with their annual google keynote event,but this 2023

event was far more diffrent from the previous and everyone can agree with me on this.they had alot of technology and device reviews





and more important google was the number one Ai company that is before even OpenAi came into the limelight but due to safeguarding their brand

name google kept the Ai stuff behind the scenes until when openAi came with their LLM(large language model) Chatgpt. i can say it was for a good reason

because through chat Gpt many big companies have thrived other small ones have started and we even have an open source Chat gpt(open assistant not forgetting 

hugging face chat)
