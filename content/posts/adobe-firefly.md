In the recent months we have witnessed unprecedented breakthroughs in creation of realistic and high-quality images that were once only possible through human

creativity. The potential of AI in image generation is immense, opening up new possibilities in various fields such as art, design, entertainment, and beyond.

 However,Ai is coming to live and as programmers and content writers and actually everyone living in this age of AI we have to embrace it and harvest its benefits because if you don't, you are surely going to be replaced. Last week march ... 2023 was actually my favorite one because Adobe has announced an AI model in what they are calling Adobe Firefly beta which is pretty much a text to image generator like Dalle and mid-jouney,as of now It's still in beta....but still produces great content. lets look at what firefly does and how it's going to be different from other image generators.
