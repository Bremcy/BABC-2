In the recent months we have witnessed unprecedented breakthroughs in creation of realistic and high-quality images that were once only possible through human creativity. The potential of AI in image generation is immense, opening up new possibilities in various fields such as art, design, entertainment, and beyond.

However, we have to accept that,Ai AI is coming to live and as programmers and content creators and actually everyone living in this age of AI we have to embrace it and harvest its benefits because if you don't, you are surely going to be replaced. Last week march 2023 was actually my favorite one because Adobe has announced an AI model in what they are calling **Adobe Firefly beta** which is pretty much a text to image generator like **Dalle** and **mid-jouney**,as of now It's still in beta....but still produces great content. Let's look at what firefly does and how it's going to be different from other image generators.

# What is Adobe firefly

Unlike other image generators, adobe firefly comes with several added features,with adobe firefly you will be able to create stunning social media posts stunning art and everything you can imagine because with adobe your ideas are the limit. All this you will simply generate through visiting their website and writing your prompt and clicking generate. And remember you don't have to be a member of creative cloud to use Adobe Firefly.

first thing i noticed when navigating to the website is their cool UI(user interface) unlike their competitor midjourney which you can only use inside discord (which is kind of frustrating to get used to) another cool thing i noticed is that Adobe Firefly image generator is actually faster it only takes seconds to produce your image. And we can't ignore the fact that producing great images you don't have to master those long prompts.
