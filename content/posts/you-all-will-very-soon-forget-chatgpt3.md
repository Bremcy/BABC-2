> AI could be the worst invention in the history of our civilization that brings dangers like powerful autonomous weapons or new ways for the few to oppress the many. AI could also be the best invention in the history of our civilization that helps eradicate poverty and disease and fundamentally transforms our approach to understanding our place in the cosmos.

In recent months we have seen impeccable applications of AI and Deep learning. Open Ai has seemed to dominate, at least in 2022/2023 releasing models like Codex, ChatGPT3, AI-Powered Microsoft Bing search, and finally GitHub Co-pilot which was a partnership between Microsoft and OpenAi.

With Google not being really in the scenes and people really loving Gpt3 humor and of course, eliminating repetitive tasks in ways not imagined 5-10 years ago "ChatGPT3 will kill Google was all over cyberspace" this heat managed to get to the big tech company which was at the same time laying off massively. To make the long story short the odds were really not favoring Google so they went ahead and released that they had worked on the same kind of "thing" but never released it.

## Google's LaMDA

LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) is an Ai model Google Engineers had been working on but was never released as it would be "bad for business". Google makes most of its income from advertising (which seems quite abnormal) and monetizing an Ai chatbot would not be a really easy thing to do, let's explore the two options:

* Paid subscription.
* Affiliate Marketing to suggest certain products by name to the user by relating to their search.
* Running Ads which would not really work until the way Ads are ran is re-invented (who wants to see ads as they are chatting with a bot)

This means users would no longer use Google's search bar and read tens of posts before landing on the page they want. Google search has always been the way to find answers to anything but what if you would have your answer crafted from the best resources out on the web and delivered in a way you would save time, and energy and get the clarity benefit this is the new way for search. 

## The GPT3 Effect.

In the week that GPT3 was discovered, Google suffered a significant decrease in chat, and many bloggers saw their traffic tank. In a report, Google stated that it would not launch a ChatGPT3 competitor as it would ruin its reputation this made so much sense amidst their mass layoffs which now seemed normal since other big-tech companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Facebook were doing it. 

> **Jomma** gave a good illustration that if you alone, were to fart in a big restaurant then everyone else in attendance would sideline you and eventually you would be thrown out but if the majority of the people were to fart in the restaurant then they would reach a consensus that the food was bad and the restaurant was to blame.

These companies blamed the economy, and inflation as to why they had these massive layoffs and suddenly, a shameful act became a norm.

So Google's reputation was really at stake here, soon they swallowed their words and officially announced their AI chatbot.
