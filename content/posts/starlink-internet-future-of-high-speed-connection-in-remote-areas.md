Founded by SpaceX founders **Elon & Kimbal Musk** and **Gwynne Shotwell _-(chief and operating officer at SpaceX)_**, Starlink Internet is engineered and maintained by the Aerospace company Space Explorations Technologies Incorporation **(SpaceX)**. Starlink Internet is a division of **SpaceX**, the first company on earth to launch a rocket into low earth orbit and recover the booster for reusing. The main goal of starting SpaceX was to make space travel cheaper. Having achieved this made it the most appropriate company to send thousands of satellites to orbit to provide affordable, uncensored satellite internet.

## Satellite Internet What is It?

Technologically, beaming the internet in a remote area from outer space is insane making it even crazier is that the satellites are actually moving at 27 to 28,000 km/h. Does the dish move to follow the satellite? come along with me to find out how Starlink internet "magically" works.

Traditionally, geostationary satellites were the technology that existed, and Starlink could be considered as their advancement. They have (and still exist) big dishes to receive data with a diameter of about 9 meters and the smallest up to 3 meters compared to **Starlink's portable pizza-sized dishes AKA _dishy_**.

Geostationary/geosynchronous satellite is where a satellite remains in a fixed position relative to a point on the Earth's surface. They may seem stationary but are actually moving at the same speed as the Earth.

Geostationary satellites had high latency (the time it takes to send and receive a signal) causing long loading times, lags, and other issues.

As illustrated, a Starlink satellite makes 70 roundtrips while a Geostationary satellite makes a single roundtrip at the same time making it 70 times slower, Easy!

### Latency vs Roundtrip (RTT)

Round-trip time (RTT) is the total time it takes for a packet of data to travel from its source to its destination and back, while Latency is the time it takes for the data to travel from its source to its destination.

## How do Starlink satellites work?

Starlink satellites are launched into outer space by SpaceX rockets, and there has been a need to send more of them leading to the development of the starship that can carry a payload of 400 compared to the 60 Starlink satellites Falcon 9 can deploy once (currently).

A possible 40,000 will be deployed to cover the earth. It will require about 100 Starship launches to satisfy the earth. It is essential that they are regularly serviced & tracked while in space and are burnt when they can't work anymore to reduce space trash. Imagine thousands of bodies over our heads, this would cause shadows -_A disadvantage of launching objects into space._

> Anything with this much-advanced technology can get complicated and involve a tonne of physics computations. However, we will try to keep things easy on you. To become a physicist and an entrepreneur like Elon Musk and SpaceX Engineers I recommend you throw yourself into these challenges and try to understand as much as possible. Good luck!  "_SpaceX, you are go for launch_".

This is a TV satellite dish, I am so sure you have come across one if not hundreds, these don't send data, they only receive they are a little complicated. A beam received from broadcasting satellites about 35,000 km away will hit the dish and concentrate it to the eye using the [parabolic reflector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_reflector#:\~:text=Parabolic%20reflectors%20are%20used%20to,source%20into%20a%20parallel%20beam.). Starlink dishy on the other hand sends and receives data from space -550 km as earlier noted. It is important for the beam to be tight and have a high frequency and low latency of 20m/s to allow HD streaming and gaming. The wavelength of spaceX Starlink is about {2.5} in a 550km distance. This means there are about  {figure} .... 

### The inside story of Starlink's dishy.

The dish components are two motors -used to autonomously position the dish at a specific angle in a clear Line of Sight (LoS), an ethernet cable, an aluminum back plate, and a circuit board with 640 small microchips and 20 bigger microchips also onboard is a GPS Module and the Main CPU on the other side of the PCB are copper-like structures this and other components make up 1280 antennas.

On the RHS is a single antenna made up of 6  smaller components this antenna is super complicated it makes Starlink what we know today.

Starlink offers speeds of up to 50-500 mb/s ranging from $110 to $500 uncapped internet.

This technology will now be available in Kenya in a few months. [Order now](https://www.starlink.com/deposit/?invitationCode=bac3f2cb-d738-4c02-8810-d92e7faf45d5&processorToken=850570f5-68dc-4137-8e51-43d76401e8f8)
