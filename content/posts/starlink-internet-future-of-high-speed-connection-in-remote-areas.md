Having achieved this was the most appropriate company to send thousands of satellites to orbit to provide cheap, uncensored satellite internet.

## Satellite Internet What is It? 

Starlink is a concentration of thousands of satellites orbiting Low Earth Orbit (LEO) -much closer to earth at about 550km all over the earth. As of now Jan 25, there are about 4,000 Starlink satellites orbiting the earth at a speed of about 17,500 miles per hour (28,000 km/h). Traditionally geostationary satellites
