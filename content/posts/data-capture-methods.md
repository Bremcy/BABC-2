# **What is data capture?**

If you’re wondering how data capture works or how it could benefit your business, this guide is for you.

**Data capture** is the process of getting information together for the computer to process.

## Indirect and direct methods of capture

**Indirect methods**-This involve preparing data into a form that a machine can read before feeding the data into the computer e.g. **key to disk**.

**Direct methods** - Because of human errors in the handling of data. Methods have been developed so that the computer can read the information directly without keying in eg **MICR**, **OCR, Barcodes**, and **mark sensing**.

#### MICR (magnetic ink character recognition)

In this form of data capture, the computer can read certain numbers which are written in magnetic ink. You can see these numbers written on the bottom of the **bank cheques**. without MICR cheques, someone would have to key all the information contained on the cheque into the computer.

#### OCR (Optical character recognition)

Optical character readers can read characters that are printed in ordinary ink by the amount of light they reflect. Usually, the reader can only be used with characters that are of a particular style or font.

Machines are now available which can read people's handwriting directly. This is quite an improvement because people handwriting styles are very different.

Optical character readers are expensive devices because they are very complex .before long we will see many more of these machines in use.

#### Barcodes

Barcode codes are made up of a series of light and dark bands. To feed the information to the computer. The barcode reader sends out a **laser beam** of light across the barcode. it detects the width of the lines and the computer can understand the information contained in them such as price manufacturers and size.

After capturing the information, barcode scanners link to a host computer or tablet and transmit that information in real time, without additional human intervention. This helps retailers automate **data collection** processes and reduce human errors like inventory tracking and processing point-of-sale transactions.

#### Types of barcodes

##### 1-dimensional (1D) barcodes

1D barcodes are a series of black and white bars that can store information like a product’s type, size, and color. You can find 1D barcodes on the top of universal product codes (**UPCs**) of a product’s packaging. This helps track packages through package delivery service providers like UPS, FedEx, the US Postal Service, and Canada Post.

##### 2-dimensional (2D) barcodes

2D barcodes are more complex than 1D barcodes. They can include more information than just text, like price, inventory levels, and even a product image. There are plenty of barcode scanners that support 2D barcodes. While not all barcode scanners can read 2D barcodes, Lightspeed Retail POS is compatible with several wireless barcode scanners that support 2D barcodes.

#### Mark sensing

Mark sensing involves detecting pencil or ink marks made on a document. usually, this involves drawing a line or marking a certain area on a document.

Mark sensing is used mainly for making **multiple choice exam papers**, and **questionnaire**s, making up information after **electricity** or **gas meters** have been read so that it can be input directly into the computer. Football pool coupons are also read using mark sensing.

#### Magnetic encoding

If you look at a bank credit card or a card that can be used in a cash dispenser you will notice that it has a dark band on the front. The stripe on the card consists of a magnetic material that can be used to hold information. this is called **magnetic encoding.**

magnetic encoding is sometimes used on price labels and goods in certain shops. this information contained on the price ticket is read directly into the computer using a **wand reader.**

#### ICR(Intelligent character recognition)

intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) also known as Intelligent OCR is a technology used for **extracting handwritten text from image files**. It is an advanced version of OCR technology where Machine Learning algorithms and **AI** intelligently interpret data in forms and physical documents through the recognition of various handwritten styles and fonts.

ICR allows users to quickly read handwritten information on paper and convert it into a digital format. **ICR engines** work with OCR to automate data capture from forms and eliminate the need for keystrokes for entering data. It features a high level of accuracy and is a reliable way to save time in processing a variety of documents.

#### IDR(Intelligent Document Recognition)

Intelligent Document Recognition (IDR) extracts invoice information from the emailed documents to create invoices and then import them into **Payables.**

Many suppliers and customers choose to send and receive Payables invoices electronically via email. IDR can process these invoices and extract the required fields to create invoices in Oracle Payables. IDR supports the entire invoice lifecycle with a seamless and secure user experience.

IDR enables our customers to quickly process supplier invoices from payment entry. It requires minimal setup and configuration, reducing the total cost of ownership and enhancing capital management.

#### Manual keying

Manual keying or data entry is still relevant with certain types of unstructured data where automated capture methods achieve low accuracy levels or volumes are so low and variable that automation is not justified. ProcessFlows can provide manual keying, verification services and even hybrid automation as a managed service.

#### NearShore keying

Nearshore keying is the same as Manual keying but instead of the task being completed in-house it is delivered by a managed service or delivery center within the European Union. Nearshore keying of Metadata can be an appropriate option when there are highly variable documents being processed or where automated methods result in exceptions that need to be handled manually.

Process Flows can provide manual keying, verification services and even hybrid automation as a managed service

#### Digital forms web or App

When collecting information from users, which doesn’t exist already, it often makes sense to capture the data through a digital form either on the web, via an intranet page, or smartphone app. Digital forms can be designed to structure the answers and data collected by avoiding too many open answers. They can also dynamically adapt to responses and prepopulate where information exists already. Ie. address

#### Web scraping

Since there is now a huge amount of data on the web, web scraping tools, called web bots or crawlers (ie. Google spiders) are used to crawl through web pages and code to collect, analyze and index specific data. Web scraping is used to capture and monitor many types of web data such as news, updates, prices, contacts, policies, share data, currencies, connected devices, comments and reviews – basically anything accessible via the web

#### Augmented reality

Augmented reality is closely linked to video analysis and involves the real-time processing of camera footage looking for programmed “trigger” objects. If a trigger object is identified, a process is executed to for example display an overlay graphic, video or other web data. AR applications are increasing in popularity as the digital and physical worlds get closer ie Google Streetview, Skyview, and Pokemon. Our Airelens AR solutions are used to assist Remote Services operations in the field

#### Artificial intelligence and data capture

Artificial Intelligence is ultimately an umbrella term for different artificial intelligence techniques. AI is best viewed in the context of the use case and application. All of the methods described here can be augmented to some degree or another by Artificial intelligence such as
