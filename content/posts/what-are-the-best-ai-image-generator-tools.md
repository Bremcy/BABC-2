Artificial intelligence is becoming popular nowadays even with different types of Ai being released in the market which are actually accessible to anyone in the world as long as you have your phone or computer. Nowadays, it's very difficult to recognize what is made by Ai and a human. especially art which for the longest time humans have been known to create some of the most stunning art. One example is Mona Lisa, which despite being drawn a century ago we still value. And still, people from all walks of the world fly all the way to the **gallery of the Louvre Museum in Paris** museum just to see Monalisa's art.

But personally, if I were to be asked Monalisa's art usually receives a lot of unnecessary attention maybe because of its artist Leonard DaVinci who was best known to hide messages in his art maybe that's why. But one shocking fact is that today using the right prompts and Ai tools you can be able to create Monalisa's art within minutes with all the details and everything check this out.

But today we are not going to look at history art but more on Ai art. When I say AI art this is a broad term that needs to be broken into small pieces so that we can understand everything.

# What are Ai image generators?

Ai image generators are basically software programs that have been programmed to create art by entering a prompt of what you want to create.

## How do these Ai generators work?

As the name suggests, these AI generators are basically trained models used to create art. These models use text input from the user and through machine learning and neural networks processes the input to generate different variations of the image.

## How can I use these image generator tools?

Since the data used to train these models is huge this makes them produce unique content every time you generate an image hence they are now used by artists and fashion designers to come up with unique styles of art.

Others may just use these generators to simply create an avatar for their business artwork for their office etc. but due to the high demand for these models there are many different of them on the internet each with different capabilities and weaknesses also so if you are feeling confused on the best art generator worry no more

1. DALL-E 2

DALL-E 2 was introduced to the public on.......and since then it has gained a lot of popularity due to its capability to produce accurate creative high quality pictures.by just entering the tsxt and clicking run

DALLE-2 will produce multiple options which you can choose from or actually  run it again for refining.whats even makes dalle-2 stand out is its simple to use interface when you can even remove the background or crop the image to your liking

and yeah as the name suggest this is the version two of dalle 1..but this version 2 has come with some graet improvements which were not there before.in dalle 2 you can also uplaod an imagefrom your computer

andadding some text inputs on how you want to modify the picture and this is what makes dalle 2 stand out among the rest generators some of the creations of dalle 2 include

 

2\.stable diffusion

satble diffusion was developed by satbilityAi  with EleutherAI and LAION,this is the simmplest to use with its fast accesibility faeture and also the best options for newbies who want to crate ai art for the first time

one major drawback to this ai generators is the size an quality of an image.where they only produce a small sized image but with the beta version of stable diffusion it is able to produe high quality 512x512 pixel images.

some of images created using stable diffusion:

3 jasper.a.i

if you are looking for a generator that will give you high quality images for personal or even commercial use then jasper ai should be your first option.this tool is mostly used by graphic designers to create stunning art or even used

to get ideas.jaspear ai is actually very simple to use and you dont even have to have any design experience in order to use it it beginner friendly and most of all the best high quality image generator. you can also use it to create website designs

business advertisement and more.let me show you some art i craetaed by using jasper ai

Night cafe

Night cafe is unique among all the other ai generators due to its ability to create art in specific art styles.some popular at styles include “oil painting,” “cubist,” “fantasy,” or “3D game.”

which when used well with certain keywords can give you very stunning outputs..Also with night cafe you can be able to make videos.even if its not that high quality videos as you would produce by our normal camera 

we can say its an improvemnt considering that the video is generated from the thin text input and with that only its able to produce very creative art.but a major drawback for night cafe is not free like others you are even limited to produce

only five arts and if you want to contiue a $7.99 dollar cahrge is issued.for us who like free things this is a major disspointment.night cafe images

Midjourney 

when it comes to create photo realistic ai images mostly faces which are very difficult to produce with other generators then midjouney is the best. Many people ussully use midjourny to create celebrity faces or even try to 

craate imaginative art.unlike other models midjourney is operated through a discord server.where every art you creted is stored there or you can even download.this discord bots are used to refine the picture and produce a very

high quality images with diffrent artistic style after producing you a can also choose the best image produced or even refine it with the options given.Also mid journey is not free to use by and you are required to pay........

to use it. the best part is that you can join a work space and learn how others are producing their art and get inspired by others.after producing you can showcase your work or even sell it as everything you produce you are actually 

allowed to own it. you will also be shocked to realize there are artist on fiverr who sell that service of creating art using midjourney there this is also a source fof income to many.

craiyon(Formerly DALL-E mini)

This is my favourite generator as its free to use and its actually accesible to anyone by just visiting their website.unlike dalle craiyon is a little bit slow in terms of speed but so you need to patient while using craiyon.i have used dalle 2 and stable diffusion before

and found that they are both similar in that they are censored so you cant just put any prompt.but with craiyon you are granted all the freedom in the world to put the prompt you want and with this kind of freedom the end resultt is limitless like you can create anything that is in

your mind.and yo are added the advantage of craeting specific style of art a feature you only get with night cafe.check out this craiyon ai image generated:

pixray

Pixray is a go to tool for all developers due to its ability to provide apis which you can use on your own project or project and a fun fact also pixray is free to use

also you may think that if pixray is only for tech savvy people but no. pxray website has the simplest and a beginner friendly interface.the best part is that while generating you are able to see everything as its happening 

right there on the website so you get an idea of what actually happens in the backend. i must say this was a good and unique touch that pixray deployed.Also whe you head to settings thats where the fun begins yoo are given

freedom to transform your picture into difrent styles still you can convert them into videos and edit them in the most creative manner with all the required tools being there and remember you get to watch everything as its happening somthing you dont get with this other 

generators. 

StarryAi

with starry ai you are limited to only produce images for night sky images as the name suggests.since starry ai does not create that complicated images you are onnly required to use a very short prompt of what you want to create.very easy to use and produces very dramatic skies and stars

a go to tool for photoshop users and graphic designers i found this wonderful images created by stary ai:
