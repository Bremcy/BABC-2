Did you know that hackers can simply send you an email and by simply opening the email the hacker gets your ip address and we all know the security risks

when un unothorised person accesses your ip address...............thats how easily you can get hacked.it take s only one click of a button

but someone may still argue that the email provider should protect its users from such attacks.and yeah thats is true.but not all email providers provide

extra security fearures to their users.there are various secure email providers eg. tutanota cock.li or even hushmail but we are partucularly going to look for only one email provider called proton mail... 

and if the name sounds familiar its because of the 

famous protonVPN service that mainly focuses on securing your online precense by redirecting their traffic to a proton server based on swiss france.......

so if you were to get hacked the hacker would not be able to retrieve your ip address becaouse of the proton mail strong enscription.

so if you are you a person who values his data.or maybe looking for a secure way to send your data online  then this article is for you.

what is proton mail

protonmail is a secure email service that offers security features such as end to end data enscription to its user.and when i say end to end data 

enscription it simply means that neither a hacker nor proton mail workers can sneakily access your data. since the only person who has the key to open 

the data sent is you the receiver or the sender.proton mail goes even further by not collecting a its user data even when registering new users.

but of course when signing you will be asked for your email and password and a recovery email which is optional for that matter but highly recommended.....

it is browser based but you can still download the Androidd or ios app by simply visting the main proton mail website click download button and a qr code will be

issued now you can go ahead and scan the qr code to be redirected to the download site.

is proton mail safe?

Being on the list of the most secure email providersand competiting with big companies like gmail or outlook for microsoft i must say is not a joke but this is becouse

of how transparent and open protonmail is to their services.and since we are already taking of transparency protonmail is open source therefore if you are a developer go checkout the code at github...

or even install it on your server,one advantage about protonmail being open source is that everyone can access the code and look for security flaws or even improve the code.even though this poses some 

security risks to the company.

But on top of that proton mail also adds multi factor verification which is basically like the one offred by gmail...

how does it work

to enable multi factor verification navigate to your browser of choice click settings then click password and recovery and click multi factor authentication or two steps verifiaction

you will be required to scan a qr code in order to add proton mail to your authenticator and just like that you will be issued with a security key which you need to keep safe since its one time password 

there for you can be secure that mesages will be safe and sound even if you lose your phone since you can still use the computer to access 

your account or vice versa.the same also applies incase you get hacked..the hacker must verify using the two devices unlike other security features where if i have your password i can pontentially harm you in any way

but with proton mail you can be assured of data being secure and encripted every time.

\#stil not convinced

if you want even more security you can still add a hardware security key.which of course is not compatible with all devices therefore you need to enable TOTP authentication which will wnable you to register by simply inserting it into a 

USB port and touching it.you can even go ahead and register your phone storage as the security key but of course you need to have a data transmission cable connected after granting the required permissions you can now enjoy the cool feature of simply 

inserting your phone or usb and just like that you are logged in....you are also not limited to register multiple keys you can do this by using diffrent usb drives incase you lose one

another feature is is end to end enscription which i talked about whats even more shocking is that you can enable full enscripted communication

by using PGP which means (pretty good Privacy). which technically sounds dumb to be true but yeah thats what it means.the best use case of PGP is where you want to send very 

sensitive information to your friend....therefore you write your top secret message then under the menu option you will see an options which will require you to attach your public key to the mesage 

then in order for the recipeint to be able to read the information he will be required to enter the private key which of course will be decoded by the PGP aware email system inside proton mail.

proton mail expiration 

when writing your message just below the sibject line you will see an icon like hour glass which lets you set the expiration date

for your message.if you want to lock the message there is a lock icon which you write your password but remenber this feature is only availabele to proton mail users 

but for non proton mail users the messages will expire after 28days by default...though you are not limited to reduce the time span which is actually counted in days and hours.when the recepient receives the email

a link will be issued to view the mesage contents he or she will be required to enter a password which for that matter will be issued by the sender maybe using a diffrent secure messaging app

on top of the message a nice UI banner counts the expiration time for the message

Proton mail Pricing 

Proton mail is quite fair when it come sto pricing since you can still get a free version of proton mail which i highly recommend for people who only want to test the waters but one thing to keep in mind is that the

free version is limited to storage and the numbers of mesages you can receive per day with the free plan you get 500mbs of storage and 100 messages per day

.but if you want to extend this limitations you can go ahead and choose either for a monthly plan which goes for $4 per month and of course $48 per year.But i know it 

will take time to add this culture where you pay to send emails becaouse we are used to free email service offered by google so why pay for email while i have a free one?

yeah yeah thats true since am a gmail user myself but if you are someone who values privacy over anything else protonmail might be what you need.

Wait so you are implying that gmail isnt safe?

a small potion of that is Question is true but to have a better understanding lets deep even dipper. so its known that email uses secure TLS(transport layer security) to transmit data across the internet 

well its good its safe its the one which have been used in ages.but the problem is it gets decoded once it reaches the target mail server.and that means even if the unintended person gets the phone or the computer he 

can simply read all the data but you do realize that with proton mail which uses end to end enscription despite the email being sent to the client side you still require the secret private key to unlock the encrited mesage

and also proton mail does not access the emails i send so incase of hack the attackers will not find any data about me in proton servers remember no data like personal names or birthdates were collected during sign up. but with gmail its the very opposite of that 

since gmail has ability to read your emails and give you personalized ads according to what you like,what you search or the links you click.like no kidding every thing you do is being monitered and recorded actually thats why 

gmail makes its money....who sai it was free if you still dont believe me what about the promotions tab in your gmail user interface which brings you personalised

information of the sites you visted or even might want to visit how do u think google knows this(the answer is by making gmail available and free to all)
