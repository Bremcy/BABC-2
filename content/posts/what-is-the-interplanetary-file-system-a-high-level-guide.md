Founded by **Juan Benet** the **Interplanetary File System (IPFS)** is a fancy, alien-like name used to refer to a distributed network of computers to store and share files, providing a more secure and reliable alternative to traditional centralized systems.

## The IPFS explained.

The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  does many things under the hood, one of which is to get a response to a certain computer as a resource. _Benet argued that since servers sometimes go down causing outages, why don't I just send you what you are asking for if I have it?_ 

**IPFS was then designed as a content-addressed, versioned, peer-to-peer file system.**
