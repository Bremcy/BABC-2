Founded by **Juan Benet** the **Interplanetary File System (IPFS)** is a fancy, alien-like name used to refer to a distributed network of computers to store and share files, providing a more secure and reliable alternative to traditional centralized systems. We have relied on the web for many years when it comes to international communication, and learning skills and Juan thinks it could be in danger. As everything evolves, the web has silently been changing drastically these evolutions remain unknown to many. We are now moving to the third web, a decentralized web version, **Web3**.

## The IPFS explained.

The name IPFS was motivated by what JCR Lick called the  ARPANET, which eventually turned into the Intergalactic network. A network that could work on an Intergalactic scale.

The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  does many things under the hood, including getting a response to a specific computer as a resource. _Benet argued that since servers sometimes go down causing outages, why don't I just send you what you are asking for if at all I have it?_

**IPFS was then designed as a content-addressed, versioned, peer-to-peer file system.**

### How does the IPFS work?

When the human species becomes multi-planetary, many questions on latency arise. Since the IPFS allows serving files on a giant peer-to-peer scale, the latency becomes low. When one computer requests a certain resource (image, text) it provides a hash like this: `QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco`   with a hash like this called a **CID (Content Identifier).** Let's take a step back and understand what Content Identifiers are and how files are served.

### Content Identifiers

Content identifiers are essential for organizing and managing large amounts of digital content, and their applications include ISBNs, and URLs generally used to locate a specific resource. When files are uploaded to the IPFS they are assigned a CID unique to them across the network this unique character is used when requesting a specific file or folder.

### IPFS Hashing

The Interplanetary File system uses sha256 to encode files, a sha256 will output 256 bits equivalent to 32 bytes. Files larger than this are split into different objects and served as one when one computer requires it. The hash function generates a unique content identifier (CID) for each file, which is a fixed-length string of 46 characters (including the prefix '**Qm**'). An object can be either a single file of 32 bytes files larger than 32 bytes are split into smaller pieces called blocks, which are stored and served by different nodes on the IPFS network, maybe a selfie you uploaded. These small objects are served by different computers (nodes) to the computer that made the request. The use of content identifiers brings a new problem since files are easily located and can be accessed using a CID, companies like Cloudflare now have control over what you see and does not serve any reported files when you access the IPFS gateway using their service.

//GPT3 CORRECTION

Founded by Juan Benet, the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed network of computers designed to store and share files in a more secure and reliable manner than traditional centralized systems. With the ongoing evolution of the web, Benet believes that the internet as we know it could be in danger, and that we are now moving towards a decentralized version known as Web3.

The name "IPFS" was inspired by JCR Licklider's vision of the ARPANET as an "Intergalactic network" that could work on a massive scale.

IPFS works as a content-addressed, versioned, peer-to-peer file system. When a computer requests a resource (such as an image or text), it provides a hash code called a CID (Content Identifier) like this: QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco. This CID is unique to each file uploaded to the IPFS network and is used to locate a specific file or folder.

The Interplanetary File System uses the SHA-256 hash function to encode files, which outputs 256 bits (equivalent to 32 bytes). If a file is larger than 32 bytes, it is split into smaller pieces called blocks and served as one when a computer requests it. An object can be either a single file of 32 bytes or multiple objects that join to form a large file. These small objects are served by different computers (nodes) to the computer that made the request.

While content identifiers are essential for organizing and managing large amounts of digital content, they also present a new problem: files can be easily located and accessed using a CID
