  ### Galaxy Z flip4 Summary.

The Galaxy flip4 is not dustproof and only water-resistant at the max height of 1.5 meters and not beach/swimming pool recommended which is too bad but at least you can grab your flip4 from your bathtub or sink in case it slips as a result of the sleek design.

This is a blow to the scuba divers and swimming YouTubers so I guess you’ll have to hold on to your iPhone 13 pro max which has a rating of “IP68” which means they are fully protected from dust and can handle being underwater for up to 30 minutes at a depth of 6 meters w-a-a-a-y enough to get the job done.

 It comes with Virus and malware protection powered by McAfee and a secure folder or in my words (vault) to keep your credentials and any other stuff you want to throw in safe.

Of course, it comes with a OneUI 4.1 based on Android 12

The fingerprint sensor comes built into the power button which also allows you to scroll the screen or slide down the notifications

The Z flip4 battery is quite larger at 3,700 mAh 25W and 15W/ Fast charge and 4.5W Reverse Fast charging compared to Z flip3 3300mAH 15W  and 10W reverse charging.

Other features are support of E-sim and has a pre-installed screen protector

Flex your life!
