Everyone is going to agree with me when I say WhatsApp is the best messaging app to chat with friends and family. One reason is that it's free, it's decentralized, it's secure as all the conversations are end-to-end encrypted and the best part of all its has no ads. which makes our life simpler since you can chat securely. 

Without having to worry about those annoying ads every now and then or even being redirected to unknown URLs, we can say WhatsApp has come a long journey. Last year we were introduced to communities, are a great way to organize related groups. You can read the full article on  [WhatApp new features 2022](https://www.bunnieabc.com/posts/what-s-app-new-features-2022/) it was not long before we were introduced to WhatsApp avatars, which is a new personalized way to express yourself. I have already covered that topic on[ WhatsApp Avatars](https://www.bunnieabc.com/posts/whatsapp-new-features-2023/) Just to be on the safe side make sure you read both of them before reading this. But that aside for now, let's focus on recent features. 

Whatsapp status has been the same you either share photos or even share a video. but with the recent update which was officially announced on Feb 7, 2023. Whatsapp status has received a lot of attention with a few improvements, which for the longest time people have been waiting for, some even upgraded to GB WhatsApp which offers more features. Let's have a look at some of the features and upgrades that WhatsApp status has received.

# link with image previews

If you have ever sent a link to someone. and wished that maybe the link would look a liitle bit nicer or maybe a new format like an image which shows what to 

expect the other side.maybe in future we are going to see this implementation....no am just kidding the time is now. you dont have to be worried about opening spam

links that will take you to unknown websites as before clicking an image preview will be provided. this feature can be seen in the chat section and status also and you know what this means 

for marketers who sell their products online that they can now be selling their products and providing a link which shows the the customer what to expect on the other side
