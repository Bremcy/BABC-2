The Ai war continues, and the best is yet to come. The same week after Google announced integrating their workspace with generative AI was still the same week that **Microsoft** announced that they will be releasing **Microsoft copilot** which will be embedded inside **Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, Microsoft Teams**, and **Microsoft business chat** and pretty much every tool that Microsoft owns you won't miss a sprinkle of some AI features. This comes after OpenAI released ChatGPT 4 which is an advancement of the GPT 3.5 The reason why open AI first announced the model and then Microsoft followed is because the same gpt4 will be integrated with this Microsoft tools, in what they are calling **Microsoft co-pilot.**

> “Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing, which will fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth. With our new copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface natural language.” **Satya Nadella**

# What is Microsoft Co-pilot?

If you are a developer, you pretty much guessed it already. Co-pilot is an AI assistant that helps one to autocomplete code just by reading the comments or even giving the right code suggestions. A more familiar example is chat gpt, but the difference is that the co-pilot is more focused on writing code and nothing else, but code.

However, Microsoft co-pilot is completely different from the normal GitHub co-pilot, because according to Microsoft they will be rolling out co-pilot in two ways. One is where co-pilot will be your assistant in word while writing documents in Excel while calculating stuff and generating graphs and pretty much every Microsoft tool.

The other version of Microsoft Co-pilot is **Microsoft Business Chat.** which will be using All the data from your **Microsoft Office tools** to maybe create updates on the change of stock this week.it may also scan your documents and provide a summary of the whole and other cool things We could never think there were possible. Let's check how you could use each tool with this embedded Ai to increase your productivity and most importantly save time.

One point to note is that it is not the first time Microsoft is introducing AI into its tools. Many don't remember, but before copilot, there was **Clippy, (**_a cartoonish character in the shape of a paperclip with two large googly eyes and expressive eyebrows_). which mostly used  to pop up on the screen to offer assistance and suggest helpful features, such as formatting text or inserting graphics. That being said we can't compare co-pilot with Clippy for obvious reasons.

## Co-pilot in word

## Co-pilot in Excel

## Co-pilot in Outlook

With Microsoft co-pilot in your emails, it means you can just ask the AI to write emails for you on (X) subject. Also, you no longer have to respond to 100 emails in your inbox. As the AI can just do it for you if it can read your emails, it also means it can delete the less important emails or even spot spam and also detect phisy links.

It can also summarize emails for you and give you a summarized sample, hence making your emails sound literate and straight to the point and most important increase productivity as you can't miss any email updates from your company as you will be alerted on every important emails.

## Co-pilot in Microsoft Teams

Microsoft 365 users will be able to summon Copilot to provide information on an upcoming Microsoft Teams meeting, preparing people with updates on related projects. organizational changes like recent hires, and even updates on co-workers who might have returned from vacation. Let's say you miss a meeting or get late The Ai will update you on what you have missed with well summarized notes of what was discussed or even a recorded video chat of the passed meeting.

## Co-pilot in PowerPoint

You will no longer have to worry about the tedious work of creating presentation slides as the co-pilot as your assistant things are made easy for you. Remember copilot is just like a chatbot, so you can just tell it to create an 8-slide presentation for you, and it will just do exactly that. Also, you can use your documents as the reference to create a slide presentation for you.I have to admit this will be the coolest feature on Microsoft Office Suite.

## The Ai Battle

If we look closely these two companies are pretty much at war with each other even if we can see it. But the best part is they are giving us good products. One good example is ChatGPT or even microsoft 365 suite.

Even if in comparison microsoft copilot features are pretty much the same as google generative AI. we have to admit that microsoft is winning here Remember they own  **75%** percentage of ChatGPT, and they have business chat which is a new feature microsoft collective suite embedded with AI unlocks a lot of capabilities.

With Copilot, you’re always in control. You decide what to keep, modify or discard. Now, you can be more **creative** in Word, more **analytical** in Excel, more **expressive** in PowerPoint, more **productive** in Outlook, and more **collaborative** in Teams.
