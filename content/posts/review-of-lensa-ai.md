Are you bored with your usual plain selfies worry no more because **Lensa AI** is here 

# What is lensa Ai

Lensa ai was first launched in 2018 as a normal photo editing app with filters that could change a normal picture to a work of art...this was no different from other editing apps e.g. **Snapchat** **face tune** or even **TikTok**. 

So Lensa AI had to change the game by introducing **"magic avatar"** a feature that enabled images to be transformed into digital works of art.

# What's the difference between Lensa AI & other image generators?

Unlike other image generators, let's take **Dalle** for instance which is a text-to-image AI model where you must put text to generate an image. whereas **_with Lensa AI_** all you have to do is to select a style and the AI will produce different variations of the image to get better results. You are required to upload **15** to **20** images to train the models.
