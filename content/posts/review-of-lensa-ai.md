Are you bored with your usual plain selfies worry no more because[ **Lensa AI**](https://prisma-ai.com/lensa) is here

# What is lensa Ai

Lensa ai was first launched in 2018 as a normal photo editing app with filters that could change a normal picture to digital work of art, but still, this was no different from other editing apps e.g. **Snapchat** **face tune** or even **TikTok** by that time.

So Lensa AI had to change the game by introducing **"Magic Avatar"** a feature that had other cool features inside its sleeve e.g.

**Portrait retouching** where you no longer have to worry about blemishes in your face the app detects them and removes them for you. Another feature is,

**background replacement** where you can remove your normal boring background and add another custom-made background.

**Color correction** you are also not limited to adjusting the color in your photos. Adjusting the brightness and contrast is an added advantage. One particular feature that amazed me while I was trying out the app is that you can add brightness to certain areas of the photo and even darken some areas according to your taste. Isn't this cool considering AI is doing this for you? Another cool feature is that unlike other image generators where after uploading the image you leave all the work to the AI. with the Lensa app there are sliders and buttons to control how much of something you want if for example the filters are too much you can just reduce without having to regenerate another image.

# lensa Ai Installation

One thing to keep in mind is that Lensa AI is an image editing **app** available in both iOS and android. At the time of writing this blog, there is no web browser-based Lensa AI website for **Windows users,** but there is one for the Mac operating system. ü§® this was qiute frustratingüòûüòû at first becouse c'mon why only windows users that dont have support and am not trying to hate on lensa but we hope this will change over time.

So i went ahead to install it on my phone then i get this

........

okay okay i know i need to upgrade my device but why do this to me lensa am not gonna lie but at that time i felt like am from 90's trying to install  windows 11 on my .....old computerüò£üò£.therefore to avoid getting dissapointed when installing you need to have...........................

# How does Lensa Ai Work

So basically Prisma Labs Inc. which is the company that owns Lensa AI took the[ Stable Diffusion ](https://www.blog.bunnieabc.com/posts/what-are-the-best-ai-image-generator-tools/)and fine-tuned their model with large datasets and images from the internet so that it could be able to recognize faces.

# ü§îWhat's the difference between Lensa AI & other image generators?

Unlike other image generators, let's take **Dalle** for instance which is a text-to-image AI model where you must put text to generate an image. whereas **_with Lensa AI_** all you have to do is to select a style be it **_anime_**, **_pop_**, **_fantasy_** or even **_stylish_** and the AI will produce different variations of the image to get better results. You are required to upload **15** to **20** images so as to train the models.

but you know whenever there is uploading of pictures there have to be some security risks.but **prisma labs** made it clear that the images are only uploaded to train the model in order to produce better results.they also annouced that they dont store the images but are ussually deleted every time after generating an image so you have to upload another image the second time you want to generate another image. just to be on the safe side go ahead and read their privacy policy terms .................üòÅwho reads this terms anyway

# Is it true that lensa Ai produces uncensored images

at first when i heard about chatgpt i heard about how it was delivering conversations like a human being also when i heard about bard(google ai model) it was because of it being........ when i first heard about dallle it was becaouse of its power to generate photorealistic images.

but to be honest when i heard about lensa ai it was because of how people were describing it as undresser.but cmon this is an ai model it uses its input to generate the results which for that matter the data is collected from the internet where there are all sorts of images(porn images undressed women name it) therefore the model just like other models uses the information to
