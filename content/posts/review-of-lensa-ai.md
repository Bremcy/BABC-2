Are you bored with your usual plain selfies worry no more because **Lensa AI** is here

# What is lensa Ai

Lensa ai was first launched in 2018 as a normal photo editing app with filters that could change a normal picture to digital work of art, but still, this was no different from other editing apps e.g. **Snapchat** **face tune** or even **TikTok** by that time.

So Lensa AI had to change the game by introducing **"magic avatar"** a feature that other cool features inside its sleeve e.g.

**Portrait retouching** where you no longer have to worry about blemishes in your face the app detects them and removes them for you. Another feature is,

**background replacement** where you can remove your normal boring background and add another custom-made background.

**Color correction** you are also not limited to adjusting the color in your photos. Adjusting brightness and contrast is an added advantage. One particular feature that amazed me while I was trying out the app is that you can add brightness to certain areas of the photo and even darken some areas according to your taste. Isn't this cool considering the ai is doing this for you? Another cool feature unlike other image generators where after uploading the image you leave all the work to the AI. with the Lensa app there are sliders and buttons to control how much of something

# What's the difference between Lensa AI & other image generators?

Unlike other image generators, let's take **Dalle** for instance which is a text-to-image AI model where you must put text to generate an image. whereas **_with Lensa AI_** all you have to do is to select a style and the AI will produce different variations of the image to get better results. You are required to upload **15** to **20** images to train the models.
