Open Assistant a free and open source created by the people for the people

The talk of the day in the world right now is Ai(Artificial Intelligence) the biggest of them all being Chat GPT many ai products have been build on top of it 
while still others are creating other LLM(large language model) like chat GPT the most recent one was Open assistant which is similar to caht GPT but open assistant 
is free to use and open source and its being developed many members of Ai community and actually everyone can contribute to or even clone the whole reepo and run it 
locally on your machine using consumer gpu's. so you can pontentially build over it and create other cool ai products since its free to use

# How To Use Open Assistant 

when your head over to their website you will be welcomed with a nice interface but to use the model you will first be required to create an account using an 
email or either discord..another cool thing i noticed is that open assistant is available in bunch of diffrent langauge so you are not limited to use english only
also if you head to their road map document. there say that there is no need to create a model with a billion of parameters because open assiatant can be able to undersatnd
requests and retrieve useful responses from the web of course using third party api's and interface pretty much the same as chat gpt pluggins also they say that
model can also be trained to give personalised results this is a game changer for open ai considering open assistant is open source.

one amaizing thing about open assisatnt is how they are actually training the model's data. they have even a full dedicated dashbord for users to help them improve 
the model and if you want to be part of the team to help improve the model you can go to open assistant dashboard and you will be presented with various task which you will 
be required to finish in order to help improve the model that runs in the background.you can either choose to rank open assistant replies from the most important reply
to the least one basing in the accuracy of the model and readability or even chat as a user and help improve its responses as you interact with it
 you can even chat as an assistant and provide responses to the given prompts and many more notice that your work wont go unnoticed because the more you engange in more tasks 
the more and highly your chances of ranking in the open assistant leaderboard.and mostly important is that you are actually helpig the model improve the responses that 
people are going to get later on while using the model

also if you go ahead and create a new caht you can pretty much ask the ai any qustion even the more recent events because remember the ai has access the web and can pontentiaally
give you any recent happenings.also remeber since the model is still in development it may give you misguiding infor or inappopraite so its advisable to double check on 
other sources or maybe dont trust it 100% although most of the time its will get it right..another thing i noticed is that open assistant is not that good when writing code

compared to its competitor cahtgpt but we cant actuaaly compare it to GPT since its still in its early stages of development.This is however not very satisfying especially for developers
video by aienteprenuer about open assistnat

 but one thinks it ranks for its making jokes or even at personiffying other people with diffrent tones we can go ahead and ask it to "make a joke about with a tone of
donald trump elon musk or pope francis or even andrew kibe"
          {{ utube video by open assintant ceo}}

if you are a chatGPT user am sure you have one or twice asked chatGPT to do something illegal unethical or inapopraite just for the sake of testing but instead you were given a response like this
" as an ai language model am programmed to follow ethical guidelines and not to create or promote content the can be considered offensive or hurtful "

which is kind of frustrating at first but yeah for good reasons only..but unlike chat gpt which is biased open assistant is not if you go ahead and ask it ethical or religious based qustions  it will give you 
its honest decision on the (x) topic 
also when it comes to creative story telling or story continuation is not that perfect. i even tried it with code completion where it writes then after sometime it justs
stops and if you prompt it to continue it doesnt do a pretty much good job at picking up but considering its their first model we can give them credit for good work.this is however going to change overtime considerinng the number of community
behind the open source project.

so well again i don't think there's a lot of practical use cases and if you're really going to use this for your business and for automated
in various tasks you're probably still going to go to Chat GPT but this could be 
the very early days of something really really special that you could potentially be a part in building and improving
we can't really judge it right now but what excites me is the vision open assistant has  the open source nature of it that's what's so exciting about this and that's
why i think it's something worth looking into something worth supporting and if you're someone that wants to say i was part of the movement back in the very beginning when they
started to build this that's what open assistant will allow you to do you can be a part of moving open source large language models in a ai forward
 by helping open assistance train its model better hope we found this review helpful definetily go check out open assistant webpage
