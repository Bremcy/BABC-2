Before we even dive into this broad topic of quantum computing, I think the best approach would be to answer the most frequently asked questions about quantum computing so that we get a base understanding of quantum computing. so lets get started. this questions I've received more than 10 tens in Quora.

W**hat is the difference between Quantum computers and other classical computers?**

A quantum computer uses quantum bits or qubits which can be either 0 or 1 at the same time and this is what gives a quantum computer its superior computing power in contrast to a normal classical computer that uses bits that are basically 0s and 1s.

More about this read the full article [here](https://blog.bunnieabc.com/posts/computer-logic/#everything-you-need-to-know-about-computer-logic).

There are several physical objects which can be used as qubits: a single photon, a nucleus, or even an electron. Yes, an electron asking yourself how well, we all know that electrons have magnetic fields, so they are basically like tiny bar magnets, and this property is called spin if you place them in a magnetic field they will definitely align with that field, just like a compass does with the magnetic field of the earth.

Now, this is the lowest energy state, so you could call it the zero state, or we can call it the **spin down** for the electron. You could also put it in one state, but that takes up some more energy.

**Are Quantum computers a replacement for classical computers?**

This is the most asked question about the quantum computer, but I hate to break it to you the answer is **NO.** Since quantum computers are not supercomputers or even universally faster. They are only faster for special types of calculations, which in that case must be complex calculations. But if you just want to use quantum computers to watch a video or browse the internet don't expect to get any kind of improvement in terms of speed you may even be shocked to realize they are even slower at doing normal computing processes.

I think since we are looking at quantum computing it will be wise  as well to know 

## What is quantum mechanics?

 Well, there are many versions of what **quantum mechanics** is but ill just tell you my version from what i understand it's a branch of **physics** just like others, which mostly deals with tiny objects which are very isolated and very cold. Computer scientists are using this knowledge in quantum to actually build new computers which actually operate on different kinds of rules than our normal computers e.g. _phones._

 It's not once or twice that you ran out of phone storage, so this means that the normal classical computers have a certain limit of computation power. So quantum computing comes to solve this problem by developing new machines that are able to adapt as the complexity of our calculations continues to rise.

 What's even more shocking is that quantum computers perform better when the problem at hand is more complex. When this technology is applied at the right places, the end product is just unimaginable. Scientists are still working on perfecting it and as we are talking right now they are real life-applications of quantum mechanics, maybe you are using them without even realizing it. a good and obvious example is **cryptography.**
