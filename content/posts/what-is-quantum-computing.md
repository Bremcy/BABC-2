Before we even dive into this broad topic of quantum computing, I think the best approach would be to answer the most frequently asked questions about quantum computing so that we get the base understanding of quantum computing. so lets to get started, this  questions I've received more than 10 tens in quora.

W**hat is the difference between Quantum computers and other classical computers?**

A quantum computer uses quantum bits or qubits which can be either 0 or 1 at the same time and this is what gives a quantum computer its superior computing power in contrast a normal classical computer uses bits.
