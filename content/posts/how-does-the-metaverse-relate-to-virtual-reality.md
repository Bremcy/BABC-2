## What is the difference between Metaverse and Virtual Reality?

**Virtual Reality:** in other words (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. It typically involves the use of a headset or other device that allows the user to see, hear, and interact with virtual objects and environments. VR can be used for entertainment, education, or a variety of other purposes.

**Metaverse:** On the other hand is a virtual-shared space that is created by the convergence of the real world and the virtual world. It is a global network of virtual reality spaces that people can access and interact with using avatars and is seen as a potential evolution of the internet.
