Windows 11 was released on October 5, and while it is a better version of Windows 10, many people are still using the old version because they are not sure if it is stable. It's been a year since its release, and Microsoft has been working hard on **_polishing_** and **fixing** the **bugs** and performance of Windows 11. 

**Is it worth it to update from Windows 10 to 11?** Yes, it is worth it since Windows 11 comes with a wide range of features, either previous updates to Windows 10 or new features introduced in Windows 11. That being said, we can now look at the noticeable improvements, performance, and design changes in the Windows 11 update.

### App folders in the Start menu

Microsoft introduced a brand-new design for the start menu which has been built from the ground up. With Windows 11 version 22H2, now the user can be able to customize the pinned apps area, create app folders, and resize the pinned apps to show one more or one fewer row.

 When you want to create an app folder all you have to do is drag one app icon over the other, wait a bit then let go to create the folder. If you want to rename a folder, first reorganize apps within a folder, and then move the folder around in the pinned area of the start menu. This freedom to create and personally reorganize your apps and folders gives users a great experience since it helps the Start menu feel less cluttered.

### File Explorer

There are a ton of improvements to File Explorer with Windows 11 version 22H2, First, the new "Home" page which is now the default page when you open the file explorer app Previous users of Windows 10 can notice a slight change in layout with a new "favorites" and "recent" area below the usual quick access folders.

Microsoft has also moved user folders from the "THIS PC" page, which now only shows storage devices. This takes time to get accustomed to but after using it a little bit you get the hang of it. now if you want to access your user folders, you are required to use the new Home page or the sidebar. Finally, Microsoft is also adding tabs to the file explorer app. Many people have been asking for this feature, which just works as expected, just like in browsers e.g. Chrome, and Firefox, the tabs are found along the top of the app where you can open new tabs, and switch between them.

### Touch Improvements

With the 2022 update, Microsoft further improves the touch experience for touch users with the introduction of gestures. The previous version had a "tablet mode" interface which was only for tablet users. With this new update, Microsoft has changed the interface for desktop touch users as well. The new gestures available with version 22H2 are:

> * Swipe up from the bottom middle of the screen to access Start.
> * Swipe right in the Start menu to access the All Apps list.
> * Swipe up from the bottom right of the screen to access Control Center.
> * Three finger swipe left or right in the middle of the screen to switch between open apps.
> * Three finger swipe up in the middle of the screen to access Task View.
> * Three-finger swipes down in the middle of the screen to minimize all running apps.
