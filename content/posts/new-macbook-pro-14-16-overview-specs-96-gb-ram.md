## The Moore's Law:

Moore's Law is a prediction made by **Gordon Moore**, the co-founder of Intel, in 1965 **_that the number of transistors on a microchip would double approximately every 18-24 months,_** this period is approximately 2 years. This prediction has been observed to hold true over the years, leading to a rapid increase in the power and efficiency of computer processors. In real life, this same law is seen in the formation of a baby. In 9 months two small cells combine to form billions of complex cells to form a human baby, they keep doubling each month as the baby grows. **Evolution.**

Apple has recently released its latest MacBook, an epic next-generation creation featuring 96 Gigs of RAM. Normally computers with this high capability are not available to the public as they are super expensive. They were only used for memory-intensive tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, and scientific simulations: you can now experience this type of a high-end desktop on your lap.
