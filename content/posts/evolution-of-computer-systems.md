There have been a lot of breakthroughs in the fields of computer and information technology and this is going to continue in the future, but all these trends will be influenced by the following: 

1. **_Rapid evolution in computer hardware and software_** 
2. **_Artificial intelligence_**
3. **_Expanded information highway_**

## Rapid Evolution in computer hardware and software

Since the introduction of computers in the business world around the 1950's a lot of technological improvements have been made both in hardware and software. Future trends will see reduced size and cost of components but increased capability. Improvements in input, processing, storage, output, and communication devices have led to faster, cheaper, and more reliable data processing devices.
