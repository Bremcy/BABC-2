When writing a blog about device review we must follow these simple guidelines.

* be straight forward
* Be sure of what you are writing, especially device features.
* Keep it as short as possible

This should always be the format for writing a device review blog.

## To boost the post’s SEO, include a keyword in the title.

Product reviews are great if you want to compare products or gear for your readers. They'll keep coming back to you for your expertise and real-world examples.

Every reliable product review should start with an introductory paragraph. This is your chance to hook your readers right in and let them know what to expect.

 Are you reviewing one product or comparing a few? What is the full name of the product(s)? Share with your readers your expertise in this area.

 Your frustration with products out in the market that hasn’t met your needs; and why this review will offer them the ins and outs of the product’s benefits.

## Your First Impressions

Your readers want to feel like they are experiencing the product for the first time with the same attention to detail that you have. This is your place to be descriptive and offer a clear account of the look and feel of the product and all of its features.

 Make sure to include images to help your storytelling come alive.

## How Have You Tested?

##### Include personal anecdotes of how the product helped you. When, where, and how did you use the product? The more personal you are, the more relatable and trustworthy you'll be. If you had others test the product, share this with your reader.

##### People might not be aware of all the ways a product might help them out. So be sure to highlight these in your post. You may mention ways they hadn't even thought of!

##  Pros and Cons

Be sure to empathize with your readers. Point out their frustrations and then how the product might help (or not!). You'll need to figure out what their problems are, and how the product could solve them.

If you're comparing a few different products, include a graph or table where people can see similarities and differences right away. This helps readers choose which option to buy.

Not everyone has access to the product you're talking about, for one reason or another. You might want to list a few alternatives they can choose from.

 They'll love you for it.

##  The Final Score

Firstly, remind your reader (once again) of your years of experience in this area and what makes you the perfect person to give a final evaluation. It's not required for every review, but a rating definitely helps. Sum up your thoughts and opinions on the product with a rating. 5 out of 5 stars? 1 out of 2 thumbs? Let people know what you think.
