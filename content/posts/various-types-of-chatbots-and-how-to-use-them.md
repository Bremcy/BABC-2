# What is a chatbot?

A chatbot is a “ computer program designed to simulate a conversation with human users, especially over the Internet.” Chatbots are often used in customer service, marketing, and other areas where automated communication with customers or users is necessary.

## Chatbot and Artificial Intelligence

**AI (artificial intelligence)** and chatbots are related, but they are not the same thing. AI is a broad term that refers to the ability of a computer or machine to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. On the other hand.

**Chatbots** are a specific type of AI that is designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the Internet. While chatbots can be powered by AI, not all chatbots are powered by AI. Some chatbots are designed to follow a set of pre-defined rules and responses, and they cannot learn or adapt to new situations. These types of chatbots are often referred to as "rule-based" or "scripted" chatbots.

## What are the different types of chatbots?

### 1. Menu/button-based chatbots

Menu/button-based chatbots can be found in a variety of places, such as messaging apps, websites, and mobile apps. They are designed to be easy to use, as users can simply select an option or button to get the information they need or complete a task.

Here is an example of how a menu/button-based chatbot might work:

**User:** "Hello, I'm looking for a pair of shoes."

**Chatbot:** "Sure thing! What type of shoes are you looking for? You can choose from the following options: sneakers, sandals, boots, or dress shoes."

**User:** "Sneakers."

Chatbot: "Great choice! Do you have a specific brand in mind? You can choose from the following options: Nike, Adidas, Converse, or Puma."

**User**: "Nike."

**Chatbot:** "Got it! Here are some Nike sneakers we have available. Which one would you like to purchase?"

### 2. Linguistic Based (Rule-Based Chatbots)

Rule-based chatbots are often used in customer service or support contexts, where they can provide quick and accurate responses to common questions or issues. They are typically programmed to recognize specific keywords or phrases, and they respond with a pre-written message or set of instructions.

Here is an example of how a linguistic-based chatbot might work:

**User:** "I need help with my account."

**Chatbot:** "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you please tell me more about the issue you are experiencing with your account?"

**User:** "I forgot my password and can't log in."

**Chatbot:** "No problem! You can reset your password by clicking on the 'Forgot Password link on the login page. Alternatively, you can also contact our customer service team for assistance."
