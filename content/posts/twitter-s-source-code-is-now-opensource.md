About six months ago, Elon Musk paid 44 Billion Dollars for the Twitter acquisition, since then Elon Twitter's CEO has done and said a lot of bizarre things: He fired half of the employees -some of them in the comment section gave blue check marks to the underserved and unbanned some accounts -like Donald Trump.

With all this happening, the platform seemed to tank daily making its value $20 billion or in simple words, -24 Billion Dollars of its initial worth.

## You have  to pay for a Twitter checkmark

Elon announced that everyone would have to pay $8 for a blue checkmark and businesses would have to pay $1,000 for a golden checkmark. However, a couple of people and companies declined the idea of paying for a verification badge. The New York Times for example declined to pay stating that it no longer represented authority and expertise and rather represents something someone just paid to acquire.

Elon commented on this saying that The New York Times was being hypocritical as it also asks people to pay for subscriptions. He then jokingly said "**We'll take it off then**" he then added 

>  "**The real tragedy of** [@NYTimes](https://twitter.com/NYTimes) **is that their propaganda isn’t even interesting. Also, their feed is the Twitter equivalent of diarrhea. It’s unreadable. They would have far more real followers if they only posted their top articles. The same applies to all publications**"

and that's it NYTimes was stripped of its badge after a few days.
