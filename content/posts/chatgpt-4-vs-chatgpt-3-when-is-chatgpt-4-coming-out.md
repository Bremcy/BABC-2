> We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers.

# When Is ChatGPT 4 Coming Out?

ChatGPT 4 was rolled out to the public on March 14-2023 and is limited to plus members.GPT-4 is available as an API for developers to build applications and services through the [OpenAI API waiting list](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api).

During the presentation, some of the model's amazing capabilities were shown which included:

• GPT-4 has a higher level of context

 • It is a raw intelligence upgrade

 • It is a multimodal, vision model 

• It's better at bridging the practical application gap 

**let's break down this into short summaries:** 

When you ask chatgpt4 to summarize a block of text and only use words starting with a specific letter, it doesn't strain at all. The model was able to summarize an OpenAI blog post with a single sentence with all letters starting with the letter "Q".
