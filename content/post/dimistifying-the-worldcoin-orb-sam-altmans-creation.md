## But what is an ORB?ðŸ¤”

An ORB is a spherical gadget used by Worldcoin agents to scan your face but mostly targets the eyeballs to harvest your mutable biometric eye data.

> As we work towards decentralization, we are incrementally open sourcing the Orb. The goal is to provide transparency and, eventually, the ability to verify our claims. Ultimately, we plan to decentralize everything involving the Orb, enabling others to develop, manufacture, and operate similar devices to issue Proof-of-Personhood credentials in a privacy-preserving manner.
