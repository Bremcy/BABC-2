description: Threads is a new social media app launched by Meta Platforms Inc,
  the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. The app is similar to
  Twitter in that it allows users to share short, threaded messages. However,
  Threads is focused on the user rather than the audience, and it offers a
  number of features that Twitter does not, such as the ability to censor
  comments and preview link destinations. As a result, Threads has the potential
  to overtake Twitter in popularity.

Meet Twitter, …. Sorry Threads rather.

Threads, a social media application launched on 5th July 2023 to rival Twitter. The app is owned by Meta Platforms Inc well known for being Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp parent company. 

In recent months, we’ve seen a lot of big tech companies pick fights: **Microsoft vs Google, Amazon vs Google, Twitter vs Facebook, and Apple vs Facebook** to the extent of physical fights against the CEOs with a cage fight between Elon Musk & Zuck the Boss planned - they are dead serious.

Threads, accessible as a native app on [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002) and [Google Play ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.barcelona&hl=en_US)is a new way for influencers to share more than photos with an Instagram & Twitter feeling. The UI is identical to Twitter threads which is a way to share a threaded/continued story.

A Twitter thread comprises a sequence of interconnected tweets originating from a single user. By utilizing a thread, individuals can furnish supplementary context, offer updates, or expand upon a specific point by linking multiple tweets in succession. This is the same idea but with an Instagram touch because people love Instagram.

## Why Is Thread a rival?

Twitter, recently acquired by Elon Musk has seen many changes in the last months some of them are: 

- 72% layoffs and resignations bring its headcount from 7,500 to 1300.
- Open-sourcing their code on [Github to show transparency](https://www.bunnieabc.com/posts/twitter-s-source-code-is-now-opensource/)
- And of course, losing money, the company is now worth $15 Billion according to the Wall Street Journal

Amongst others. While Twitter managed to be in the headlines, for controversy Elon -Twitter & Tesla CEO in a tweet said the app has roughly 259 million daily active users and a total of 396.5 million users globally. With that little background, you now know a little bit about Twitter.

Threads on the other hand is fairly new but has an amazing future. Recent updates show that the App has over 10 million signups with the first user as Mark Zuckerberg in 5 days at the time of writing this article. 

## How was it easy for Threads to gain users?

Super easy:

- Many influencers on Instagram with a massive following are simply advertising Threads for free with the intention to build a career and a massive following on the new app.
- The app integrates directly with Instagram making it easy for them to transfer their following from Insta to Threads.
- New Influencers are trying their best to build careers and take the mantle there.
- The features are Twitter-like but focused on the user rather than the audience.
- Instagram users with a massive following simply suck over at Twitter having little impact Mark Zuckerberg too has a little over a thousand Twitter followers.
- Lastly, Threads reserves your Instagram username for you till you are ready therefore you have no excuse.
