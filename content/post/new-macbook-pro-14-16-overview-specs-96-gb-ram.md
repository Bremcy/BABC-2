# The Moore's Law:

Moore's Law is a prediction made by **Gordon Moore**, the co-founder of Intel, in 1965 **_that the number of transistors on a microchip would double approximately every 18-24 months,_** this period is approximately 2 years. This prediction has been observed to hold truth over the years, leading to a rapid increase in the power and efficiency of computer processors. In real life, this same law is seen in the formation of a baby. In 9 months two small cells combine to form billions of complex cells to form a human baby, they keep doubling each month as the baby grows. **Evolution.**

## 6x faster than the Intel-based Macbook

Apple has recently released its latest MacBook, an epic next-generation creation featuring 96 Gigs of RAM. Normally computers with this high capability are not available to the public as they are super expensive. They were only used for memory-intensive tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, and scientific simulations: you can now experience this type of high-end "desktop" on your lap. And with power comes 22 hours of battery life, the longest a Mac has ever seen.

* From $166.58/mo. for 12 mo. or $1999
* 14.2-inch or 16.2-inch  
  Liquid Retina XDR display
* Apple M2 Pro  
  or Apple M2 Max chip
* 16GB to 96GB unified memory
* 512GB to 8TB storage
* Up to 22 hours of battery life
* Touch ID
