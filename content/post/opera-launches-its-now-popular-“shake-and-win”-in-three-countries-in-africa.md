The opera browser “Shake and Win” campaign, which was introduced to celebrate the 2019 African Cup Of Nations (AFCON), was to allow users to win prizes.

During the football world cup, Opera browser gave lots of prizes and rewards to more than one million people in Africa during the “Shake and Win” campaign. This comes after Opera browser, re-launched the “Shake and Win” in Africa last year which was well received as Opera browser got a spurt in its users both in Kenya and Nigeria.
