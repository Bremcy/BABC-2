On 21st January 2015, WhatsApp launched a Web version of the mobile app. Like many apps, it is difficult to succeed without a web presence. While it’s easy for apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to run fully-fledged on the web it’s not the case with WhatsApp due to its somehow Encryption and decentralized nature. Also, WhatsApp does not have a login form or password to authenticate users. However, they still found a way even with these hurdles. Threads by Meta, an app recently launched to rival Twitter still doesn't have a browser interface. To connect and use your Whatsapp account on the web you have to scan a QR code. Here are the steps:

On your WhatsApp application:

1.  Click on the three dots on the top right.
1.  See “Linked Devices”? Click on that.
1.  Now click on the “Link a new device” button

On your computer or tablet: 

1.  Open your preferred web browser `chrome, safari, firefox, or Bing Safari and Bing users might           
1.  have additional setup later. Use Chrome instead.
1.  Visit web.WhatsApp.com
1.  Now simply scan the QR code using your phone and that's it.

Recent advancement in the WhatsApp web interface has seen it get additional features like an Advertising button, status rings,  sticker suggestions when you type a message, status reaction stickers, and many others but still doesn't bring the native app feeling. Today we dive into extensions that can bring this feeling and functionality.

1. [WA Web Plus for WhatsApp](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wa-web-plus-for-whatsapp/ekcgkejcjdcmonfpmnljobemcbpnkamh)

Web Plus tops the list, it’s lightweight, easy to use, and simply works. To install visit [Web Plus on the Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wa-web-plus-for-whatsapp/ekcgkejcjdcmonfpmnljobemcbpnkamh) and click install, afterwards, you'll need to configure what additional settings you need added to boost your productivity and general feeling when interacting with Whatsapp web.

This extension has the ability to add a login form to give you access to messages, that way nobody will come to check your messages in case you forget your laptop or tablet on the desk. This is easily my favorite feature. Other features include: 

1. Blurring contact names & group names
1. Profile photos, and messages 
1. Restoring deleted messages.
1. Hiding blue ticks and online status
1. Enabling dark mode
1. Adding like buttons
1. Additional business features

This is the most used Whatsapp web extension in the Chrome web store surpassing 1 Million users.

  2. [Privacy Extension For WhatsApp Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-extension-for-wha/jbojhlhhggfmmkpefknmbdhlaghehini)

Nothing too fancy about this one, because it lacks a Lock Whatsapp page feature yet, is meant for privacy. Other interesting features as the extension name suggests are directed to privacy.

On launch toggle what you want visible to others and what should be hidden. Here are the choices.

  Blur…:

- All messages in the chat.
- Last message preview.
- Media preview in the chat.
- Group and contact names.
- Profile pictures and message input.
