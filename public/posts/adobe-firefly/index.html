  "articleBody": "In the recent months, we have witnessed unprecedented breakthroughs in the creation of realistic and high-quality images that were once only possible through human creativity. The potential of AI in image generation is immense, opening up new possibilities in various fields such as art, design, entertainment, and beyond.\nHowever, we have to accept that, AI is coming and as programmers and content creators and actually, everyone living in this age of AI we have to embrace it and harvest its benefits because if you don’t, you are surely going to be replaced. Last week on March 2023 was actually my favorite one because Adobe has announced an AI model in what they are calling Adobe Firefly beta which is pretty much a text-to-image generator like Dalle and mid-journey, As of now it’s still in beta,but still produces great content. Let’s look at what Firefly does and how it’s going to be different from other image generators. but before that\nWhat is Adobe Firefly? Unlike other image generators, Adobe Firefly comes with several added features. With Adobe Firefly you will be able to create stunning social media posts, stunning art, and everything you can imagine because with Adobe your ideas are the limit. All this you will simply generate through visiting their website and writing your prompt and clicking generate. And remember you don’t have to be a member of creative cloud to use Adobe Firefly.\nThe first thing I noticed when navigating to the website is their cool UI(user interface) unlike their competitor mid-journey where you can only generate images inside Discord (which is kind of frustrating to get used to) another cool thing I noticed is that Adobe Firefly image generator is actually faster it only takes seconds to produce your image. And we can’t ignore the fact that by producing great images you don’t have to master those long **prompts. (**like midjourney)\nBut you will be provided with already made styles, and all you have to do is come up with a prompt, choose a style, and just like that click generate. What this means is that you don’t have to be a pro to use Adobe Firefly. And actually, everyone can create stunning art with Firefly since it’s only a matter of minutes if not seconds to get used to it.\nAdobe Firefly Features Adobe Firefly is coming with a lot of features like Text to image(which we have talked about) text effects, recoloring vectors, in-painting, text-to-vectors, and many more.\nText Effects With text effects, you will be able to add styles and textures to letters and objects. This new text effects feature is new to the Ai image generators like Dalle and the like, therefore this is going to change a lot.\nmostly for graphic designers. Imagine turning the normal letters or words into leaves, metal-like objects or even bubbles tiger skin, Everything you can think just type in the prompt, and it will be right there with you.\nRecoloring vectors if you have ever used Adobe Illustrator. You must be familiar with using vectors and the different ways of adding colors to them. But now imagine all that tedious work being done for you. This will greatly increase creation time and in the end happy clients and more creativity for creators. But since this new technology is in beta only a few can access it, also for now, the only features available in Firefly beta are text-to-image and text effects.\nWhat to expect with Adobe Firefly adobe’s future is bright remember they have been at the forefront by owning adobe creative suite which comprises many apps used by creators and artists. Since they don’t want you to go searching for AI features in other apps (mid-journey) they are bringing the AI features inside the creative suite. This will change how we work mostly Photoshop and Illustrator. These are some of the features Adobe will be releasing soon in Adobe Firefly.\n  In-painting Imagine being able to erase a part of your image and replace it with whatever you like. Let’s say you don’t like the color of your shoes, great just erase them using the in painting feature, and replace them with whatever color you want. okay fine, you don’t like your picture background, use in painting to change it simple!. The end capabilities of what we can do with in painting are just great The best part is that Firefly generates not one but a few options to choose from.\nText to pattern and Text to vector Creating a vector object has been made easy because you have two options use the text-to-vector feature or use text to image feature for me, they both work the same i don’t see why Adobe categorized them as two different features,\nHowever, this feature will be great mostly in Figma (which Adobe now owns) and illustrator. remember just a prompt and leave the rest to the Ai before I had always used Photoshop to create pattern vectors with were not that great since they lacked the sense of realism but now with this cool feature. I will be able to create all types of imagery with ease and actually even more faster.\n3D design This will be a huge time saver for 3d creators where they will use the AI to fully add textures and decorate their 3d designs. and considering the fact that Adobe owns Adobe Dimensions, which is a great tool for 3d designers. I can only imagine🤔 where the future of 3d design is going.\nHow will Adobe train their models? Adobe claims they didn’t steal creator’s art to train their model. Since they used Adobe stock photos (which they own) to train Firefly. Therefore, for now we won’t hear artists suing Adobe for their art creations. And actually this is true since the image produced by Firefly has that stock photo “taste”.\nFirefly is great it’s level of detail is incredible. is also great, but we can still notice the difference between Midjouney and Firefly by comparison. I think the beta version of Firefly produces images like Midjourney v4, which is actually great because it’s still in beta. also for that reason, every image you create with Firefly will have a label or a mark showing its produced by firefly beta so of now, you can’t use Firefly creations for commercial use.\nWelcome, to the Ai world Adobe is a company known for its image and video software. Photoshop, for example, is a great tool, and a must-have for every graphic designer. But c’mon we have to admit when it comes to great designers softwares then Adobe is the place to be. since there have now entered into\nthe AI game we are going to see a lot of advancements in Image generation features. And since Adobe is usually at the forefront of creative apps and software we can expect great things now. Before then let’s explore what this text to image and letter effects. has to offer.\n",

<p>But you will be provided with already made styles, and all you have to do is come up with a prompt, choose a style, and just like that click generate. What this means is that you don&rsquo;t have to be a pro to use Adobe Firefly. And actually, everyone can create stunning art with Firefly since it&rsquo;s only a matter of minutes if not seconds to get used to it.</p>
<h2 id="adobe-firefly-features">Adobe Firefly Features<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#adobe-firefly-features">#</a></h2>
<p>Adobe Firefly is coming with a lot of features like <strong>Text to image</strong>(<em>which we have talked about</em>) <strong>text effects</strong>, <strong>recoloring vectors</strong>, <strong>in-painting</strong>, <strong>text-to-vectors,</strong> and many more.</p>
<h3 id="text-effects">Text Effects<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#text-effects">#</a></h3>
<p>With text effects, you will be able to add styles and textures to letters and objects. This new text effects feature is new to the Ai image generators like Dalle and the like, therefore this is going to change a lot.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/uploads/firefly_rubberballs_24949-scaled.webp" alt="adobe Text Effects"  title="adobe Text Effects"  />
</p>
<p>mostly for graphic designers. Imagine turning the normal letters or words into leaves, metal-like objects or even bubbles tiger skin, Everything you can think just type in the prompt, and it will be right there with you.</p>
<h3 id="recoloring-vectors">Recoloring vectors<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recoloring-vectors">#</a></h3>
<p>if you have ever used Adobe Illustrator. You must be familiar with using vectors and the different ways of adding colors to them. But now imagine all that tedious work being done for you. This will greatly increase creation time and in the end happy clients and more creativity for creators. But since this new technology is in beta only a few can access it, also for now, the only features available in Firefly beta are <strong>text-to-image</strong> and <strong>text effects.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-with-adobe-firefly">What to expect with Adobe Firefly<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-to-expect-with-adobe-firefly">#</a></h2>
<p>adobe&rsquo;s future is bright remember they have been at the forefront by owning adobe creative suite which comprises many apps used by creators and artists. Since they don&rsquo;t want you to go searching for AI features in other apps (mid-journey) they are bringing the AI features inside the creative suite. This will change how we work mostly <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator.</strong> These are some of the features Adobe will be releasing soon in Adobe Firefly.</p>

<h3 id="in-painting">In-painting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#in-painting">#</a></h3>
<p>Imagine being able to erase a part of your image and replace it with whatever you like. Let&rsquo;s say you don&rsquo;t like the color of your shoes, great just erase them using the in painting feature, and replace them with whatever color you want. okay fine, you don&rsquo;t like your picture background, use in painting to change it simple!. The end capabilities of what we can do with in painting are just great The best part is that Firefly generates not one but a few options to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="text-to-pattern-and-text-to-vector">Text to pattern and Text to vector<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#text-to-pattern-and-text-to-vector">#</a></h3>
<p>Creating a vector object has been made easy because you have two options use the <strong>text-to-vector</strong> feature or use <strong>text to image</strong> feature for me, they both work the same i don&rsquo;t see why Adobe categorized them as two different features,</p>
<p>However, this feature will be great mostly in <strong>Figma</strong> (<em>which Adobe now owns</em>) and illustrator. remember just a prompt and leave the rest to the Ai before I had always used Photoshop to create pattern vectors with were not that great since they lacked the sense of realism but now with this cool feature. I will be able to create all types of imagery with ease and actually even more faster.</p>
<h3 id="3d-design">3D design<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3d-design">#</a></h3>
<p>This will be a huge time saver for 3d creators where they will use the AI to fully add textures and decorate their 3d designs. and considering the fact that Adobe owns Adobe Dimensions, which is a great tool for 3d designers. I can only imagine🤔 where the future of 3d design is going.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-adobe-train-their-models">How will Adobe train their models?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-will-adobe-train-their-models">#</a></h2>
<p>Adobe claims they didn&rsquo;t steal creator&rsquo;s art to train their model. Since they used Adobe stock photos (<em>which they own</em>) to train Firefly. Therefore, for now we won&rsquo;t hear artists suing Adobe for their art creations. And actually this is true since the image produced by Firefly has that stock photo <strong>&ldquo;taste&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p>Firefly is great it&rsquo;s level of detail is incredible. is also great, but we can still notice the difference between <strong>Midjouney</strong> and <strong>Firefly</strong> by comparison. I think the beta version of Firefly produces images like Midjourney v4, which is actually great because it&rsquo;s still in beta. also for that reason, every image you create with Firefly will have a label or a mark showing its produced by firefly beta so of now, you can&rsquo;t use Firefly creations for commercial use.</p>
<h2 id="welcome-to-the-ai-world">Welcome, to the Ai world<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#welcome-to-the-ai-world">#</a></h2>
<p>Adobe is a company known for its image and video software. Photoshop, for example, is a great tool, and a must-have for every graphic designer. But c&rsquo;mon we have to admit when it comes to great designers softwares then Adobe is the place to be. since there have now entered into</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/uploads/adobe-firefly-is-a-text-to-image-generator-that-didnt-steal-your-work.webp" alt="adobe firefly"  title="adobe firefly "  />
</p>
<p>the AI game we are going to see a lot of advancements in Image generation features. And since Adobe is usually at the forefront of creative apps and software we can expect great things now. Before then let&rsquo;s explore what this <strong>text to image</strong> and <strong>letter effects</strong>. has to offer.</p>
