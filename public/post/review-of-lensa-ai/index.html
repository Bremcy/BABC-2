  "articleBody": "Are you bored with your usual plain selfies worry no more becauseLensa AI is here\nWhat is lensa Ai Lensa ai was first launched in 2018 as a normal photo editing app with filters that could change a normal picture to digital work of art, but still, this was no different from other editing apps e.g. Snapchat face tune or even TikTok by that time.\nSo Lensa AI had to change the game by introducing ‚ÄúMagic Avatar‚Äù a feature that had other cool features inside its sleeve e.g.\nPortrait retouching where you no longer have to worry about blemishes in your face the app detects them and removes them for you. Another feature is,\nbackground replacement where you can remove your normal boring background and add another custom-made background.\nColor correction you are also not limited to adjusting the color in your photos. Adjusting the brightness and contrast is an added advantage. One particular feature that amazed me while I was trying out the app is that you can add brightness to certain areas of the photo and even darken some areas according to your taste. Isn‚Äôt this cool considering AI is doing this for you?\nAnother cool feature is that unlike other image generators where after uploading the image you leave all the work to the AI. with the Lensa app there are sliders and buttons to control how much of something you want if for example, the filters are too much you can just reduce without having to regenerate another image.\nLensa Ai Installation One thing to keep in mind is that Lensa AI is an image editing app available in both iOS and android. At the time of writing this blog, there is no web browser-based Lensa AI website for Windows users, but there is one for the Mac operating system. ü§® this was quite frustratingüòûüòû at first because c‚Äômon why only Windows users that don‚Äôt have support and am not trying to hate on Lensa, but we hope this will change over time.\nSo I went ahead to install it on my phone, then I get this (app not compatible with the device)\nokay okay I know I need to upgrade my device but why do this to me Lensa I feel like am from 90‚Äôs trying to install Windows 11 on an old Windows XP (2001 version) operating systemüò£üò£.therefore to avoid getting disappointed like me when installing you need to have\n iOS 15.0 or later for iPhone users macOS 11.0 or later. for Mac users iOS 15.0 or later. for iPod touch users And to you, my Android friends,üòÑ the app requires Android 7.0 or later and is compatible with most smartphones and tablets also.  But if you are defiant like I am and still insist on installing Lensa on a windows machine there is a workaround for you where you are required to install memu another third-party app that is going to ease the installation process and you will be able to install lensa ai on your pc\nHow does Lensa Ai Work So basically Prisma Labs Inc. is the company that owns Lensa AI(best known for specializing in deep learning-related products. so they took theStable Diffusion and fine-tuned their model with large datasets and images from the internet so that it could be able to recognize faces. now they could be able to manipulate scenes and enhance skin tones and other visual elements.\nü§îWhat‚Äôs the difference between Lensa AI \u0026 other image generators? Unlike other image generators, let‚Äôs take Dalle for instance which is a text-to-image AI model where you must put text to generate an image. but with Lensa AI all you have to do is to select a style be it anime, pop, fantasy, or even stylish and the AI will produce different variations of the image. To get better results, You are required to upload 15 to 20 images to train the model.\nRead more about Dalle inüëâ The Ultimate Guide to AI Art Generators\nWhenever there is uploading of pictures there have to be some security risks. However, Prisma labs made it clear that the images are only uploaded to train the model to produce better results. they also announced that they don‚Äôt store the images but are usually deleted every time after generating an image so you have to upload another image the second time you want to generate another image. just to be on the safe side go ahead and read their privacy policy terms, who reads these terms anywayüôÑ\nLensa Ai Pricing I know you have been waiting to hear this but lensa ai is not free. yeah, you heard me right but you do get a one-week trial to try out some of the features after that you are required to pay USD 29.99 per year. but still, if you like free things just uninstall the app and install it again to get the free trial again. and am not saying that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve doneüòÇüòÇ.\nThe avatars pricing is quite fair considering Premium subscribers will have a 50% discount\n $3.99 for 50 unique avatars (5 variations of 10 styles)\n$5.99 for 100 unique avatars (10 variations of 10 styles)\n$7.99 for 200 unique avatars (20 variations of 10 styles)\n Is it true that Lensa Ai produces uncensored images At first, when I heard about chat GPT It was about how it was delivering conversations like a human being also the first time to hear about Bard (google AI model) it was because of how people were describing it as sentient but shockingly enough when I first heard about lensa AI it was because of how people were describing how the Ai undressed them or even pornified them.üò∂ The viral AI avatar app Lensa undressed me‚Äîwithout my consent\nbut c‚Äômon this is an AI model it uses the input data to generate the results which for that matter the data is collected from the internet where there are all sorts of images (porn images undressed women name it) therefore the model is just like other models uses the information to generate according to its training data so the model should not be the one to be blamed. but to people who put their naked pictures out there. but when the company was asked about the issue the spokesman had this to say.\n ‚ÄúStable Diffusion is trained on unfiltered data from across the internet, neither us nor Stability.AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, ‚Äúcould consciously apply any representation biases or intentionally integrate conventional beauty elements. The man-made, unfiltered online data introduced the model to the existing biases of humankind,‚Äù\n But I know many will still argue out why not just filter the output to restrain images of people being naked or such. yeah, I wonder the same thing tooüòè.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Are you bored with your usual plain selfies worry no more because<a href="https://prisma-ai.com/lensa"> <strong>Lensa AI</strong></a> is here</p>
<h1 id="what-is-lensa-ai">What is lensa Ai<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-lensa-ai">#</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://prisma-ai.com/lensa">Lensa ai</a> was first launched in 2018 as a normal photo editing app with filters that could change a normal picture to digital work of art, but still, this was no different from other editing apps e.g. <strong>Snapchat</strong> <strong>face tune</strong> or even <strong>TikTok</strong> by that time.</p>
<p>So Lensa AI had to change the game by introducing <strong>&ldquo;Magic Avatar&rdquo;</strong> a feature that had other cool features inside its sleeve e.g.</p>
<p><strong>Portrait retouching</strong> where you no longer have to worry about blemishes in your face the app detects them and removes them for you. Another feature is,</p>
<p><strong>background replacement</strong> where you can remove your normal boring background and add another custom-made background.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/uploads/2022-3.webp" alt=""  />
</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong> you are also not limited to adjusting the color in your photos. Adjusting the brightness and contrast is an added advantage. One particular feature that amazed me while I was trying out the app is that you can add brightness to certain areas of the photo and even darken some areas according to your taste. Isn&rsquo;t this cool considering AI is doing this for you?</p>
<p>Another cool feature is that unlike other image generators where after uploading the image you leave all the work to the AI. with the Lensa app there are sliders and buttons to control how much of something you want if for example, the filters are too much you can just reduce without having to regenerate another image.</p>

<h1 id="lensa-ai-installation">Lensa Ai Installation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lensa-ai-installation">#</a></h1>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that Lensa AI is an image editing <strong>app</strong> available in both iOS and android. At the time of writing this blog, there is no web browser-based Lensa AI website for <strong>Windows users,</strong> but there is one for the <strong>Mac</strong> operating system. ü§® this was quite frustratingüòûüòû at first because c&rsquo;mon why only Windows users that don&rsquo;t have support and am not trying to hate on Lensa, but we hope this will change over time.</p>
<p>So I went ahead to install it on my phone, then I get this (<em>app not compatible with the device</em>)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/uploads/jsjhhhsjkjkjk.PNG" alt="device not compatible for installation of lensa ai"  title="lensa Ai Installation"  />
</p>
<p>okay okay I know I need to upgrade my device but why do this to me Lensa I feel like am from 90&rsquo;s trying to install Windows 11 on an old <strong>Windows XP</strong> (2001 version) operating systemüò£üò£.therefore to avoid getting disappointed like me when installing you need to have</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS 15.0 or later for iPhone users</li>
<li>macOS 11.0 or later. for Mac users</li>
<li>iOS 15.0 or later. for iPod touch users</li>
<li>And to you, my Android friends,üòÑ the app requires Android 7.0 or later and is compatible with most smartphones and tablets also.</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you are defiant like I am and still insist on installing Lensa on a windows machine there is a workaround for you where you are required to install <a href="https://www.memuplay.com/how-to-use-com.lensa.app-on-pc.html#:~:text=Lensa%3A%20Photo%20Editor%20for%20Perfect%20Pictures%20%2D%20FAQs&amp;text=Use%20Lensa%3A%20Photo%20Editor%20for%20Perfect%20Pictures%20on%20PC%20by,app%20on%20PC%20with%20MEmu">memu</a> another third-party app that is going to ease the installation process and you will be able to install lensa ai on your pc</p>
<h1 id="how-does-lensa-ai-work">How does Lensa Ai Work<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-does-lensa-ai-work">#</a></h1>
<p>So basically Prisma Labs Inc. is the company that owns Lensa AI(best known for specializing in deep learning-related products. so they took the<a href="https://www.blog.bunnieabc.com/posts/what-are-the-best-ai-image-generator-tools/"> Stable Diffusion </a>and fine-tuned their model with large datasets and images from the internet so that it could be able to recognize faces. now they could be able to manipulate scenes and enhance skin tones and other visual elements.</p>
<h1 id="whats-the-difference-between-lensa-ai--other-image-generators">ü§îWhat&rsquo;s the difference between Lensa AI &amp; other image generators?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#whats-the-difference-between-lensa-ai--other-image-generators">#</a></h1>
<p>Unlike other image generators, let&rsquo;s take <strong>Dalle</strong> for instance which is a text-to-image AI model where you must put text to generate an image. but <strong><em>with Lensa AI</em></strong> all you have to do is to select a style be it <strong><em>anime</em></strong>, <strong><em>pop</em></strong>, <strong><em>fantasy,</em></strong> or even <strong><em>stylish</em></strong> and the AI will produce different variations of the image. To get better results, You are required to upload <strong>15</strong> to <strong>20</strong> images to train the model.</p>
<p><em>Read more about Dalle inüëâ</em> <a href="https://www.blog.bunnieabc.com/posts/what-are-the-best-ai-image-generator-tools/" title="The Ultimate Guide to AI Art Generators?">The Ultimate Guide to AI Art Generators</a></p>
<p>Whenever there is uploading of pictures there have to be some security risks. However, <strong>Prisma labs</strong> made it clear that the images are only uploaded to train the model to produce better results. they also announced that they don&rsquo;t store the images but are usually deleted every time after generating an image so you have to upload another image the second time you want to generate another image. just to be on the safe side go ahead and read their <a href="https://lensa-ai.com/terms#:~:text=You%20acknowledge%20and%20agree%20that,subject%20to%20our%20Privacy%20Policy.&amp;text=TL%3BDR%3A%20You%20can%20upload,no%20ownership%20over%20such%20content.">privacy policy terms</a>, who reads these terms anywayüôÑ</p>
<h1 id="lensa-ai-pricing">Lensa Ai Pricing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#lensa-ai-pricing">#</a></h1>
<p>I know you have been waiting to hear this but lensa ai is not free. yeah, you heard me right but you do get a one-week trial to try out some of the features after that you are required to pay USD 29.99 per year. but still, if you like free things just uninstall the app and install it again to get the free trial again. and am not saying that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve doneüòÇüòÇ.</p>
<p>The avatars pricing is quite fair considering Premium subscribers will have a 50% discount</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$3.99 for 50 unique avatars (5 variations of 10 styles)</p>
<p>$5.99 for 100 unique avatars (10 variations of 10 styles)</p>
<p>$7.99 for 200 unique avatars (20 variations of 10 styles)</p>

<h1 id="is-it-true-that-lensa-ai-produces-uncensored-images">Is it true that Lensa Ai produces uncensored images<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-it-true-that-lensa-ai-produces-uncensored-images">#</a></h1>
<p>At first, when I heard about <a href="https://www.blog.bunnieabc.com/posts/what-is-chat-gpt-and-why-you-need-it/"><strong>chat GPT</strong></a> It was about how it was delivering conversations like a human being also the first time to hear about <strong>Bard</strong> (google AI model) it was because of how people were describing it as sentient but shockingly enough when I first heard about <strong>lensa AI</strong> it was because of how people were describing how the Ai undressed them or even pornified them.üò∂ <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/12/1064751/the-viral-ai-avatar-app-lensa-undressed-me-without-my-consent/">The viral AI avatar app Lensa undressed me‚Äîwithout my consent</a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/uploads/ab0ecaaa24fac6d70548412e14a74eef.webp" alt="Is it true that Lensa Ai produces uncensored images"  title="Is it true that Lensa Ai produces uncensored images"  />
</p>
<p>but c&rsquo;mon this is an AI model it uses the input data to generate the results which for that matter the data is collected from the internet where there are all sorts of images (porn images undressed women name it) therefore the model is just like other models uses the information to generate according to its training data so the model should not be the one to be blamed. but to people who put their naked pictures out there. but when the company was asked about the issue the spokesman had this to say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Stable Diffusion is trained on unfiltered data from across the internet, neither us nor Stability.AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, ‚Äúcould consciously apply any representation biases or intentionally integrate conventional beauty elements. The man-made, unfiltered online data introduced the model to the existing biases of humankind,‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I know many will still argue out why not just filter the output to restrain images of people being naked or such. yeah, I wonder the same thing tooüòè.</p>
